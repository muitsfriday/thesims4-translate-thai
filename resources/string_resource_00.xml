Its amorphous shape is as weightless as the feathers that adorn its head, giving it the ability to drift through the air and avoid danger. While often mistaken as a mouth, the cavity in its face is in fact an enlarged nostril, giving it a predilection to track down the source of intensely fragrant smells.\n\nEpisode 20 of the hit TV show Voidcritters saw a flock of Meduso latch themselves onto a perfume saleswoman, causing chaos at the local mall. Our hero, Leif, cleverly helped lure the Meduso away with the scent of succulent meat when he fired up the grill in a nearby park.

  <Text Key="1BBD4EFD">{0.SimFirstName} secretly dropped {M0.his}{F0.her} card in the cubby. When {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates came in from recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} waited as {M0.his}{F0.her} crush put their coat away. Unfortunately, the {1.String} card had slipped between the cracks and was never found.</Text>
  <Text Key="C280F784">{0.SimFirstName} secretly dropped {M0.his}{F0.her} card in the cubby. When the other kids came in from recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} watched from across the room as {M0.his}{F0.her} card was opened. Glitter spilled out from the envelope, but it was surpassed in brightness by {M0.his}{F0.her} crush’s smile. Though {M0.his}{F0.her} involvement remained a secret, {0.SimFirstName} went the rest of {F0.her}{M0.his} day with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.</Text>
  <Text Key="6C66C158">{0.SimFirstName}’s crush didn’t even know {M0.he}{F0.she} existed. This was an opportunity to change that! {0.SimFirstName} bypassed the cubby in favor of a hand-delivery. Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she}  wasn’t able to find {M0.his}{F0.her} crush on the playground. By the time {0.SimFirstName} gave up and returned to the cubby, {F0.her}{M0.his} crush’s bookbag was gone and the entire opportunity had been lost.</Text>
  <Text Key="34C836E5">{0.SimFirstName}’s crush didn’t even know {M0.he}{F0.she} existed. This was an opportunity! In the heat of the moment, {0.SimFirstName} walked past the cubby and delivered the card directly into the hands of the most popular kid in school. After having it declared “the most awesome card ever,” {0.SimFirstName} was invited to hang out with the popular kids at recess and lunch whenever {M0.he}{F0.she} wanted! Doesn’t that make {0.SimFirstName} a popular kid too?</Text>
  <Text Key="E3AA4C30">{0.SimFirstName} passed by {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher, a sad little girl, and the school bully. Nothing felt “good enough” until {M0.he}{F0.she} spotted an old man, alone in the park. {M0.He}{F0.She} reached into {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack only to find that the bouquet of tissue paper flowers had been utterly demolished by {M0.his}{F0.her} homework while walking… There was probably a lesson to be learned here.</Text>
  <Text Key="5AD7AC7D">After school, {0.SimFirstName} spotted a sad girl sitting on a bench. {M0.He}{F0.She} walked over and extended the bouquet of tissue paper flowers. Upon seeing the gift, her face lit up, and she gave {0.SimFirstName} the biggest hug ever! The teacher was right—It was so rewarding to make someone else’s {1.String} special.</Text>
  <Text Key="8A634BF5">{0.SimFirstName} mulled over who to give {M0.his}{F0.her} tissue-paper flowers to, but the answer was easy! {M0.Himself}{F0.Herself}! {0.SimFirstName} strutted off, flowers in hand-that was, until the wind plucked them free and stole them! The bright flowers drifted in the wind’s current until they were little specks on the horizon, never to be seen again…</Text>
  <Text Key="79CD54BC">{0.SimFirstName} decided to keep the flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself}! While at recess, another kid spotted them and offered to trade for some real flowers. Considering it an upgrade, {0.SimFirstName} accepted. {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} started the day with nothing, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} had a bouquet of real flowers. What an enterprising young sim!</Text>
  <Text Key="693AE45F">{0.SimFirstName} decided to surprise the entire class with flowers! Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she} forgot to sign the cards and when the flowers were delivered another kid took credit. What a crummy {1.String}!</Text>
  <Text Key="7E39C92A">{0.SimFirstName} decided to surprise the entire class with flowers! While sitting in math, each flower was hand-delivered, taking enough time to get them out of a test!</Text>
  <Text Key="31B6E396">{0.SimFirstName} decided to buy flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and make it seem like {M0.he}{F0.she} was popular! Unfortunately, the plan backfired and {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates were jealous. Instead of looking cool, {0.SimFirstName} spent the rest of the day ignored…</Text>
  <Text Key="46A34387">{0.SimFirstName} decided to buy flowers for {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and make it seem like {M0.he}{F0.she} was popular! The rouse was a success until lunch when the school bully pulled {0.SimFirstName} aside and announced that they knew…\n\nThankfully, the bully thought it was funny, and {0.SimFirstName} got off scot-free (and with {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch money)!</Text>
  <Text Key="E83DBB83">Apparently {0.SimFirstName} isn’t funny. The teacher didn’t think so. {M0.His}{F0.Her} classmates didn’t think so. Even {0.SimFirstName}’s friends didn’t think so. The word being thrown around is ‘insensitive.” Apparently, {M0.he}{F0.she} needs to start taking people’s feelings a little bit more seriously and maybe not mock holidays that others hold dear.</Text>
  <Text Key="3BA0D79E">Who takes {1.String} seriously, anyways? Those kids with sappy cards were, well… saps! Not {0.SimFirstName}. Everyone who opened {M0.his}{F0.her} cards had a good laugh. Now {0.SimFirstName} is considered the funniest kid in school. Who knew {0.SimFirstName} could be such a comedian?</Text>
  <Text Key="D7708D7A">Sometimes bearing your soul through a series of revealing cards that are delivered an entire class of teenagers isn't a good idea. This was probably one of those times. While {0.SimFirstName} went in a more sensitive direction, everyone else went comedic, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} is the laughing stock of the class. Maybe in a week everyone will stop talking in goo-goo voices to {M0.him}{F0.her}.</Text>
  <Text Key="7C971FCB">“Sensitive, Sweet, Charming, Thought-provoking”—these are a few of the descriptors kids are whispering about {0.SimFirstName} in the halls. Some say, the school bully renounced his previous ‘taxation” on school lunches, the popular girls are allowing anyone to sit with them (even if they aren’t wearing pink), and nobody has been stuffed in a locker today—and all because of {0.SimFirstName}’s cards! Is this what being a teen legend feels like?</Text>
  <Text Key="E170A2C2">Was it the fact that {0.SimFirstName} went alone that made it the worst {1.String} School Party of all time? OR was it the fact that {M0.he}{F0.she} spilled punch all over {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, slipped on the floor, and then accidentally knocked down a teacher! Because, although {0.SimFirstName} felt pretty awkward standing along the wall alone, the whole knocking down a teacher thing was really bad.</Text>
  <Text Key="A638E233">{0.SimFirstName} wasn’t interested in inviting anyone in particular. Instead, {M0.he}{F0.she} decided to focus simply on being the life of the party! While {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates indulged in awkward banter and ‘wallflowering,’ {0.SimFirstName} lead the charge for fun! Who delivered flowers to everyone in attendance? Who started a Chubby Llama competition? And who talked the teacher into playing the cool music? {0.SimFirstName}, of course! It was an epic school party that begged only one question: Whatever did {0.SimFirstName} do with the chaperones?</Text>
  <Text Key="8939802B">It took courage! That’s what {0.SimFirstName} would have to keep telling {M0.himself}{F0.herself}. The moment {M0.he}{F0.she} asked that special sim to the {1.String} Party, was the exact same moment {M0.he}{F0.she} got shot down. The response “No” had been instantaneous and followed by the cruel snickers of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates. {0.SimFirstName} spent the party hiding in the bathroom. Embarrassed. With a llama cookie—which was delicious but didn’t make up for what had just happened.</Text>
  <Text Key="0FB412E6">It took most of the day for {0.SimFirstName} to work up the nerve and ask that special sim to the party, but it was totally worth it! {0.SimFirstName} stole shy glances at {M0.his}{F0.her} date as they congregated along the wall and awkwardly chatted about their classes, school sports, and the weather (which oddly had been much more active as of late)! By the time the party was over, {0.SimFirstName}’s heart was a flutter!</Text>
  <Text Key="8874A661">{0.SimFirstName} went in with hopes ablaze! {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} planned to make this the best {1.String} dance ever! That was before {M0.he}{F0.she} saw what {M0.he}{F0.she} had to work with. Crumpled decorations. No snacks. Polka music! To make matters worse, nobody else had volunteered. When the dance started, everyone blamed {0.SimFirstName} for the lame time they had.</Text>
  <Text Key="FD6F3678">{0.SimFirstName} might have been tasked with setting up for “a {1.String} Dance,” but instead, {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} be setting up for “THE {1.String} Dance.” With a flurry of banners, streamers, cookies and punch (not literally—that would be messy), {0.SimFirstName} decorated the gym for a {1.String} Dance that would be remembered for years to come!</Text>
  <Text Key="0279088C">Why decorate for a {1.String} Dance when you could sabotage it instead? That was the thought anyway. {0.SimFirstName} probably should have just decorated like {M0.he}{F0.she} said {M0.he}{F0.she} would. Not only were the pranks disappointing rather than funny, but when the teacher bit into a cookie covered in ketchup—they knew exactly who to blame. {0.SimFirstName} spent the rest of the day sitting in the hall while everyone else had fun.</Text>
  <Text Key="A476FCA9">“{M0.Prince}{F0.Princess} of Pranks.” “Destroyer of {1.String}” All titles bestowed upon {0.SimFirstName} for {M0.his}{F0.her} maniacal ingenuity when decorating the gym for the {1.String} Dance. Sure, {M0.he}{F0.she} got in a bit of trouble with the teachers, but that’s part of the fun! All of the school thinks {0.SimFirstName} is hilarious and the dance was way better than it would have been otherwise.</Text>

  <Text Key="2B391009">Concert Virtuoso</Text>
  <Text Key="2CAAE152">Bravo, {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} will bring the crowd to its feet at nearly every sold-out performance. Applause? Roses? Room keys? These things are offered up to {0.SimFirstName} on a regular basis now. Encore!</Text>

  <Text Key="D3D3C148">Saving up for art school supplies means working at the art school library. Unfortunately, the books must be re-shelved by number, and no one sees the genius in {0.SimFirstName} re-shelving them by complementary color. Visionaries are often misunderstood.</Text>

  <Text Key="6BA7EA55">{0.SimFirstName}'s heart swelled with joy at the opportunity to pass down {M0.his}{F0.her} artistic skills to the next generation of talented painters. The children's eyes were wide with wonder as {M0.he}{F0.she} gave {M0.his}{F0.her} demonstration, and they leapt to action in an attempt to recreate {M0.his}{F0.her} painting. The counselors expressed their gratitude by letting {0.SimFirstName} sign the wall of one of the camp's cabins, as well as slipping {M0.him}{F0.her} a bonus payment.</Text>
  <Text Key="23B7D67E">{0.SimFirstName} took pride in teaching the camp's self-proclaimed "artists of tomorrow". While {M0.he}{F0.she} isn't 100% certain they'll all live up to that lofty aspiration, {M0.he}{F0.she} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} did her part to usher them down the right path.</Text>
  <Text Key="114A8FEC">Having not completed all of {M0.his}{F0.her} expected goals, the art students went untaught for the day, and are angrily lodging complaints to the dean's office.

  <Text Key="A06D9F20">{0.SimFirstName} will never admit it, but {M0.he}{F0.she} greatly enjoyed booting an unruly student out of class.

Word of {0.SimFirstName}'s great job reached the dean, who paid {M0.him}{F0.her} a little bonus for a job well done.</Text>
  <Text Key="5D9C5191">{0.SimFirstName} wasn't sure how {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} deal with an unruly classroom of students, but to {M0.his}{F0.her} surprise, everyone was attentive, well behaved, and ready to learn. {M0.He}{F0.She} collected {M0.his}{F0.her} paycheck, and went about {M0.his}{F0.her} day... The more you know!</Text>
  <Text Key="CD031423">The nectar and painting class's proprietors are displeased that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to finish all of the goals, but begrudgingly paid {M0.him}{F0.her} a portion of the agreed upon payment for the part {M0.he}{F0.she} did complete.</Text>
  <Text Key="B6111DFF">The nectar and painting class went off without a hitch. So many of the happy participants signed up for another class, that not only did the program's owners pay {0.SimFirstName} a bonus, they actually painted and hung a portrait of {M0.him}{F0.her} in the lobby of the building!</Text>
  <Text Key="1F67387C">Whew, paintings can start to get really risqué when the nectar starts to flow. Ultimately though, everyone had fun and went home happy - and most importantly, {0.SimFirstName} got paid.</Text>
  <Text Key="5846E460">After reading the biography, the client wonders if {0.SimName} was really listening to how amazing he was. He gave feedback suggesting it was too "real." They agree to end the contract with a prorated fee.</Text>
  <Text Key="076D778C">{0.SimName} really captured what makes the client important and great. He can't wait for the world to find out about how awesome he is at that thing that he was so important.

  <Text Key="176CDF7D">The client is pleased with {0.SimName}'s writing. Though, he seems to think anyone would have done well, given the source material. </Text>
  <Text Key="4E032A35">{0.SimFirstName}'s contract was cut short for making all the wrong kinds of connections. They're not suggestions, they're historical! Still, they agreed to pay the minimum for the work done.</Text>

Still, {M0.he}{F0.she} got paid a bit for the portion that {M0.he}{F0.she} did accomplish, and handed the entirety of it off to the dev for them to do whatever they want with it.</Text>
  <Text Key="10DA3EC5">{0.SimFirstName} found {M0.himself}{F0.herself} on the exact same wavelength as the indie dev, and the two of them were obviously jiving when it came to each other's passion for art. The dev was over the moon for {0.SimFirstName}'s characters! Despite having to work within a very strict budget, they still managed to slip {M0.him}{F0.her} a small bonus payment to show their appreciation.</Text>
  <Text Key="AADEC28E">The indie dev {0.SimFirstName} submitted {M0.his}{F0.her} character designs to had an air of pretension that rubbed {0.SimFirstName} the wrong way. They may have been looking for passionately crafted art, but {0.SimFirstName} was just looking to get paid... and in that sense, it all worked out just fine.</Text>
  <Text Key="B5729B9C">{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the requested work, and as a result did not receive a complete payment. The game's producers mentioned that they'd wished {0.SimFirstName} had simply put in extra time to get the work done, and to not expect further contracts in the future if this is the way {M0.he}{F0.she} professionally conducts {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.</Text>
  <Text Key="8ADCEF10">It's hard to stand out when you're a nameless cog in a large machine, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to do so with {M0.his}{F0.her} stellar character creations. As a sign of thanks, the development team gave {M0.him}{F0.her} a bonus payment, and even image mapped {M0.his}{F0.her} face onto one of the enemies in the game, so that {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} be digitally immortalized!</Text>
  <Text Key="3F0C8821">The game's producers are pleased with the characters that {0.SimFirstName} created, and confirmed that his designs would appear in the final game. Not only was the pay good, but {0.SimFirstName} is now excitedly looking forward to seeing {M0.his}{F0.her} characters come to life within a digital world!</Text>
  <Text Key="63C832D3">Plumbob Pictures executives are outraged that they still had to pay {0.SimFirstName} a portion of the gig's payout, despite the fact that {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't complete all goals. In a retaliatory move, they leaked {M0.his}{F0.her} identity to the striking workers, naming {M0.him}{F0.her} as the scab that agreed to replace them.</Text>
  <Text Key="090EC82F">The film's producers are overjoyed with {0.SimFirstName}'s character concept creations! Each of {M0.his}{F0.her} designs are film ready, and the costume and makeup artists are already hard at work translating {M0.his}{F0.her} concepts into outfits for the film's stars. As a thanks for keeping the film production schedule on track, they've promised to feature {0.SimFirstName}'s name in the title sequence, and have added extra money to his payment.</Text>
  <Text Key="B53C94CC">{0.SimFirstName}'s character concepts made it to the film's producers just in time. As an industry outsider, they mentioned that {M0.his}{F0.her} creations aren't quite film ready, but they're still quite thankful to have received {M0.his}{F0.her} help.</Text>
  <Text Key="1326FC97">The client tells {0.SimName} teddy bears aren't meant to have conquering armies and epic love stories. It's a great concept, but it's both a little too mature and exciting for children. {F0.she}{M0.he} got paid a little less, since the work won't be used. </Text>
  <Text Key="83EF70EB">The stories {0.SimName} wrote are perfect for children. They'll learn important lessons, but also the parents will thank {F0.her}{M0.him} for the time they gain back each night once the kids are asleep. </Text>
  <Text Key="94B0D018">The story rewrites {0.SimName} did really helped with the story flow, really helping with the bedtime part of the stories. Just reading them made the client sleepy. In a good way.</Text>
  <Text Key="9E7CB0AE"> 'Alternate Uses for a Pet Yorier' is not what we expect out of a children's book. The detailed chapter on how they can be used in life or death survival situations alone is enough to get this pulled from store shelves. Please do not return to this office.</Text>
  <Text Key="79E855F2"> 'Vulpes Counts the Critters of the Mauven Forest' is on track to be the number #1 children's book this holiday season. It is also reported that toddlers who read this book now need both hands to show how high they can count.</Text>
  <Text Key="148A162F"> 'Bumbling Baby Bubalus' checks the right boxes. This may not be the instant classic we were hoping for, but it will be some child's treasured book.</Text>
  <Text Key="4532573C">Only being able to come up with a list of 8, it wasn't much of a top-10. {0.SimFirstName} got paid appropriately for that work, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="8214BCB0">{0.SimName} had clearly been keeping a list ahead of time. Split across 10 separate webpages, the top-10 list monetized greatly!</Text>
  <Text Key="959AAB41">{0.SimName} did a lot of back and forth with the client, arguing whether 4 should be higher or lower on the list.  In the end, {F0.she}{M0.he} got {F0.her}{M0.his} way, though.</Text>
  <Text Key="9E976B11">{0.SimFirstName} missed Fab Magazine’s deadline, causing their article to be cut from the tabloid. While {F0.she}{M0.he} was compensated for what writing they already finishing, this mistake might affect {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation as a writer.</Text>
  <Text Key="4B86D6E5">Nothing beats a good break up article. Using pictures and information provided by Fab Magazine, {0.SimFirstName} was able to craft a heartbreaking article featuring two of Plumbob Picture’s most prominent stars and how their love was torn apart by studio schedules, nightly parties, and a secret lover. Fab Magazine gushed about it so much, they used it as the cover article for their latest issue and gave {0.SimFirstName} a little extra when finalizing the contract.</Text>
  <Text Key="93AD0B2E">While the topic of {0.SimFirstName}’s article wasn’t too interesting, {F0.her}{M0.his} writing was able to punch it up enough to catch the attention of Fab Magazine editors. Enough so to get its headline featured as one of the additional articles mentioned on the cover. Not bad for a story covering a few lesser known Plumbob Picture stars.</Text>
  <Text Key="1A0EE47A">{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete one of the simplest tasks imaginable... churning out some clickbait drivel. Thankfully the website's editor didn't particularly care; after all, freelancers like {0.SimFirstName} are a dime a dozen. {0.SimFirstName} still managed to get paid for the portion of the work {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to complete, so the gig wasn't a total write off.</Text>
  <Text Key="FE224DE6">Clicks are pouring in from across the internet as readers debate the wild claims {0.SimFirstName} laid out in an article which was clearly devised to drive controversy and outrage. The website's editor couldn't be happier - {0.SimFirstName} even went so far as to format the article across a paginated slideshow, ginning up even more revenue! Happily, the gig's contract included revenue sharing after meeting a certain click threshold, resulting in some extra money making its way into {0.SimFirstName}'s pocket.</Text>
  <Text Key="D48669D3">The website's editor sighed as {0.SimFirstName} submitted a meaningless listicle, designed to drive clicks without having anything of significance to say. {0.SimFirstName} had seen this weary look on editor's faces before...

You elevate puns to daffy escapades, your one-liners leave us as empty-headed ninnies, and your gags are anything but offbeat. It has been a ludicrious journey and wish to put up with your tomfoolery again in the future.”\n Along with Witty and Wacky Inc.’s message, a large bonus was added to the contracted amount. Though why they went out of their way to make their logo sing about the bonus is anyone’s guess.</Text>
  <Text Key="B72042B0">“The silly natural of your writing as left many in our clownish workspace entertained. Witty and Wacky Inc. thanks you for providing more than the traditional double entendre and simple quip or quote.” Well it seems like the client was happy, but why was their message a video of a man in military garb?</Text>
  <Text Key="8EE1F48D">{0.SimFirstName} received an earful about "not being motivated enough" and "failing to see the vision". It was upsetting, but at least the client still transferred a portion of the expected pay.</Text>
  <Text Key="7977AC29">The game actually brought a tear to {0.SimFirstName}'s eye. Driven to finish it so {F0.she}{M0.he} could play it {F0.herself}{M0.himself}, {F0.she}{M0.he} ended up delivering way ahead of schedule. This was well appreciated by the game director, and {0.SimFirstName} was paid extra!</Text>
  <Text Key="0736D0E2">The deadline was a bit too tight to polish the game enough for the immersion to shine through. Still, the job was done and {0.SimFirstName} was paid.</Text>
  <Text Key="269E1DB8">The client was obviously upset, but it was also the most entertaining phone call {0.SimFirstName} has had in a while. Couple that with still being paid a bit of money for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, and {0.SimFirstName} is left with a very confusing feeling.</Text>
  <Text Key="ACC9FD44">The company actually had a few games they had planned to release at the same time. Due to how quickly {0.SimFirstName} was able to deliver {F0.her}{M0.his} project, it was placed at the top of the list. The party company gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a party bonus!</Text>
  <Text Key="D2FBB945">It's a fun game with friends for sure. The company was pleased with the end product and invited {0.SimFirstName} to play it with them. Unfortunately, {F0.she}{M0.he} couldn't keep up with the banter and felt a bit left out.</Text>
  <Text Key="DB227DFF">"Not you too? Does everyone want us to fail?"\n\nTrue to their word, the crowd-funded company did pay {0.SimFirstName} whatever they had left. Unfortunately, without a game to ship and running out of time, what they had was not much at all.</Text>
  <Text Key="4188FD93">The game was actually almost done. It turns out the real reason that developers were leaving the project was because of how demanding the game's creative director is. That wasn't a problem for {0.SimFirstName} though. Freelancers are used to picky and rude clients! Apologetic, the producer made sure that a little extra was added to the final payment!</Text>
  <Text Key="4F20A7B0">It was tough, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to finish on time. Despite the initial impressions, the pay was good too. The game itself is a problem, though, and {0.SimFirstName} is not expecting great reviews...</Text>
  <Text Key="E62BF37A">{0.SimFirstName} tried to explain that there was no way to work the weird mechanics into the level design, but the client wasn't having it. They claimed that {F0.she}{M0.he} just didn't understand, but it's not {F0.her}{M0.his} fault -- the design is just too ahead of their time.\n\n{0.SimFirstName} was still paid, at least. It's a fraction of the contract pay, but it's something.</Text>
  <Text Key="C5723CE6">The gimmicky mechanics were actually very simple to make. Delivering the game ahead of schedule netted {0.SimFirstName} some extra pay, which is great because the game is not original at all and will probably not do very well. Oh well!</Text>
  <Text Key="6C86CED3">Either the mechanics were too complex, or the design wasn't clear enough. {0.SimFirstName} was able to finish on time, but the game just isn't fun. It's not {F0.her}{M0.his} business to tell the client that, though. Just take the paycheck and move on!</Text>
  <Text Key="6AB47A11">The deadline arrived, and nobody is happy. At least all of the concept art and assets can be salvaged for other projects. Based on this alone, the art studio still gave a small amount of pay to {0.SimFirstName} for the time spent.</Text>
  <Text Key="12D6C5E5">The art was so gorgeous, even {0.SimFirstName} was starting to fall in love. {F0.She}{M0.He} ended up so driven to complete the game, that {F0.she}{M0.he} finished it ahead of schedule. The art studio loved that; they promised to work with {F0.her}{M0.him} again soon, and gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a lofty bonus.</Text>
  <Text Key="2BAD702E">The studio clearly underestimated the amount of work that goes into even making text-based games. Still, {0.SimFirstName} finished the project on time, and even enjoyed {F0.herself}{M0.himself} along the way.</Text>
  <Text Key="D1D7DAE6">"You better not be using my data for nefarious purposes..."\n\nIt seems trust isn't the only thing that {0.SimFirstName} lost when {F0.she}{M0.he} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} also lost most of the pay. A little is better than none at all, at least.</Text>
  <Text Key="292031AA">The client was very impressed at how fast {0.SimFirstName} was able to deliver the encrypted files. The individual, who tried their best to remain as mysterious as possible, paid a bit extra to show their appreciation.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F3B8657">The client accepted the encrypted files and pestered {0.SimFirstName} about whether {F0.she}{M0.he} made copies and are hiding them somewhere. It took a while, but {F0.she}{M0.he} managed to convince them that {F0.she}{M0.he} did not.</Text>
  <Text Key="1A4C4DCF">{0.SimFirstName} failed to encrypt all of the files in time. This seemed to be the last straw for the client, who completely broke down. They said something about "not paying the full amount" before passing out. Not a great job, but at least a little money was earned.</Text>
  <Text Key="8DA872E3">The client was shocked when the job was done ahead of schedule. Immensely grateful, {F0.she}{M0.he} thanked {0.SimFirstName} with a little bonus!</Text>
  <Text Key="5D2B0220">The client was obviously relieved when the encrypted files were delivered on time. Not one to wait for an emotional breakdown, {0.SimFirstName} quickly accepted the pay and broke contact.</Text>
  <Text Key="090AC448">Well, it seems {0.SimFirstName} doesn't know encryption either. Either that, or {F0.she}{M0.he} underestimated the amount of work. Either way, the small business owner was pretty upset. It's a good thing they don't seem to know how to file a formal complaint, so {0.SimFirstName} still received a portion of the pay.</Text>
  <Text Key="7DB5CBD4">The small business owner had no idea what was what, but accepted the job as done. Given the early delivery, {F0.she}{M0.he} even gave {0.SimFirstName} a little bonus on top!</Text>
  <Text Key="440EA9F5">The small business owner still doesn't really know what happened, but accepted the job as done. {F0.She}{M0.He} reported that the clients seemed happy with the results, so {F0.she}{M0.he} doesn't care.</Text>
  <Text Key="8B44ED21">"What do you mean you didn't finish? You're one of them aren't you?! I should've known!"\n\n{0.SimFirstName} doesn't know what happened after that, but was pleasantly surprised when {F0.she}{M0.he} still received a bit of pay.</Text>
  <Text Key="A624E235">The client became suspicious at how fast {0.SimFirstName} finished the job. It took a bit of convincing, but when the shifty individual finally turned around, they gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a nice bonus. </Text>
  <Text Key="F5789DDE">{0.SimFirstName} completed the job on time, but had to wait for the paranoid client to double check all the files before receiving the payment. Sometimes there are a few weird ones, but {F0.she}{M0.he} figures it's fine as long as the money is paid.</Text>
  <Text Key="54246CD7">{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the entirety of {M0.his}{F0.her} goals in time, and the indie studio had to apologize to their project's backers for not having anything to show in their campaign update. They attempted to deflect some of the blame to {0.SimFirstName}, but their fans weren't having it.</Text>
  <Text Key="D3B8242B">The indie studio is incredibly relieved to not only receive such high quality environment concepts from {0.SimFirstName}, but to receive them so swiftly! Their environment artists are starting immediately on turning {M0.his}{F0.her} concepts into fully featured backdrops within the studio's upcoming title. As a thanks, they've funneled some extra kick started cash away from backer rewards and into {0.SimFirstName}'s pocket.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D6DE158">{0.SimFirstName}'s environment concepts arrived just in the nick of time, allowing the team's environment artists to have enough time to create something to show in the game's next kick started campaign update.</Text>
  <Text Key="F64C6CEE">The dev team is frustrated that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete the entirety of {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks by the set milestone, causing the studio to miss an important deadline with their publisher. {0.SimFirstName} was lucky to still receive a partial payment for the portion of the work that {M0.he}{F0.she} did manage to finish.</Text>
  <Text Key="455B4B32">The studio's art director can't believe the quality of the work that {0.SimFirstName} submitted, and it was all completed so quickly as well! {M0.She}{F0.He} expressed how much {M0.she}{F0.he} wished that {M0.she}{F0.he} could offer {0.SimFirstName} a full time gig, but the studio unfortunately didn't have any headcount available to allow {M0.her}{F0.him} to do so. {M0.She}{F0.He} was able to procure a nice bonus on top of the gig's agreed upon payment though, and {0.SimFirstName} won't say no to that!</Text>
  <Text Key="2F4A926F">The dev team was pleased to receive {0.SimFirstName}'s environment concepts, but they still refused to tell {M0.him}{F0.her} the name of the game that {M0.his}{F0.her} work would be used within. {M0.He'll}{F0.She'll} just have to stay tuned to see what the team announces!</Text>
  <Text Key="40EB9DC5">The sci-fi film's production has been delayed, because {0.SimFirstName} only completed a portion of the goals that {M0.he}{F0.she} was asked to complete. Union rules still mandated that {M0.he}{F0.she} get paid for the portion of work that {M0.he}{F0.she} did complete though.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F2EFE81">The film's producers are over the moon for the sci-fi landscapes that {0.SimFirstName} envisioned. They not only paid {M0.him}{F0.her} a bonus for {M0.his}{F0.her} swift work, they also promised to insert a small Easter egg in {M0.his}{F0.her} image into the environment in tribute to his contribution!</Text>
  <Text Key="8D850FEA">{0.SimFirstName}'s sci-fi landscapes are spot on for what the film's director had in mind. The director let {M0.him}{F0.her} know that {M0.she'd}{F0.he'd} be happy to enlist {0.SimFirstName}'s talents again in the future.</Text>
  <Text Key="C26B9623">The company thanks {0.SimName} for their work, but feels the plot is too contrived and breaks fan expectations too strongly. They will let {F0.her}{M0.him} know if they want to work together in the future, but this wasn't the right project.</Text>
  <Text Key="62C7DFFF">They loved {0.SimName}'s work! Their feedback included praises for bringing back fan favorite characters, adding a new twist to old plot lines, and introducing a wholly new, interesting threat to be explored in later books. </Text>
  <Text Key="E3EB4E7C">The editors enjoyed {0.SimName}'s work and gave excellent feedback on where the next chapters could go. With the experience gained from writing for this series, {F0.she}{M0.he} could really see their career spread its wings and take flight. </Text>
  <Text Key="712F33AA">{0.SimName} really should have followed the client's notes more closely. After being told there weren't nearly enough fairies, they both agreed not to work together further. </Text>

  <Text Key="D319A4DB">{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete the full job on time, and the client didn't seem like the type to handle disappointment well. {M0.He}{F0.She} still received a portion of the job's payment...

  <Text Key="7D6C5B97">The client greatly appreciated {0.SimFirstName}'s 'professionalism' in completing the job without attracting undue interest. {0.SimFirstName} isn't the type to ask questions either; {M0.he's}{F0.she's} just happy to have the forgery gone, and some extra cash in {M0.his}{F0.her} pocket.</Text>
  <Text Key="70E1F2C4">{0.SimFirstName} felt somewhat stressed during his work for the client; {M0.he}{F0.she} had the distinct impression that {M0.he}{F0.she} was being surveilled...

  <Text Key="D5823362">{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the art dealer's tasks on time, which immediately fractured their business relationship.

  <Text Key="98CE9CCE">{0.SimFirstName}'s forgery was immaculate; {M0.he}{F0.she} nailed every aspect of the recreation which could possibly be scrutinized.

  <Text Key="7343A18B">{0.SimFirstName}'s forgery was convincing enough to allow the shady art dealer to quickly complete a sale to an all-too-eager collector, before too many questions could be asked.</Text>
  <Text Key="08EDCCD9">The shady art collector is furious that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks on time.

  <Text Key="EB60E54D">After submitting the forged painting, the true brilliance of the art collector's scheme came to light. The collector wasn't interested in adding {0.SimFirstName}'s painting to {M0.her}{F0.his} own personal collection... No, the collector was stealing the original, and replacing it with {0.SimFirstName}'s forged copy. {0.SimFirstName} was initially alarmed at the risk of being caught, but some extra hush money from the collector got {M0.him}{F0.her} to look the other way, for now...</Text>

  <Text Key="81F8849B">The contact at Llamacorn was thrilled with the early report delivery. {0.SimFirstName} received a good bit more pay than {F0.she}{M0.he} was expecting, but no complaints here!</Text>
  <Text Key="0E2F5628">{0.SimFirstName} delivered the report on time, much to the relief of the Llamacorn representative. Apparently, even as {F0.she}{M0.he} was working on the gig, Llamacorn received over 200 attacks!</Text>
  <Text Key="15F4F35E">Even though, {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} was still paid a portion of the agreed amount. The real punishment came later, when {F0.her}{M0.his} inbox was suddenly filled with spam mail.</Text>
  <Text Key="23ECEC22">Chain Mail, Inc. might seem a bit strange and shady, but they are very generous. When {0.SimFirstName} delivered {F0.her}{M0.his} report ahead of schedule, the company made sure to reward {F0.her}{M0.him} with a little extra payment.</Text>
  <Text Key="405E9BFF">The company might be shady, but they pay well. {0.SimFirstName} can't complain after receiving the paycheck, though {F0.she}{M0.he} can't get that strange feeling out of {F0.her}{M0.his} head that {F0.she}{M0.he} is seeing more spam mail...</Text>
  <Text Key="C1AFDFB5">The contact from Bubbleplace seemed all too cheerful when {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the contract.

  <Text Key="D5388931">The contact from Bubbleplace reached impressive levels of excitement when {0.SimFirstName} completed {F0.her}{M0.his} report ahead of time.

  <Text Key="4B7F49BA">The excitable representative loved the report that {0.SimFirstName} gave, and wouldn't stop praising {F0.her}{M0.him}. It was flattering at first, but it went on for far too long. After what seemed like an eternity, {F0.she}{M0.he} finally received the payment.</Text>
  <Text Key="56C18E3C">After the deadline passed and {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the job, {F0.she}{M0.he} was sent a heavily redacted email.

The client was thrilled with {0.SimFirstName}'s work, and in addition to a monetary bonus, {M0.she}{F0.he} promised to treat {0.SimFirstName} to a chili dog meal if {M0.he's}{F0.she's} ever in the area. Strange...</Text>
  <Text Key="1FDA4AC4">{0.SimFirstName} gave the client a ring, to let them know {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} completed {M0.his}{F0.her} work. They seemed to be in a hurry, only briefly glancing at {0.SimFirstName}'s updated copy before giving their approval. After receiving a swift payment, {0.SimFirstName} is ready to move on to {M0.his}{F0.her} next gig.</Text>
  <Text Key="88DC3B62">"Hah, I knew you'd fail to get the gig completely finished on time. The world has moved past print ads, and it's clearly moved past you. Here... have this pittance for the work that you put in, but know that I'm just taking pity on you."</Text>
  <Text Key="2861A4CE">"Hmph. Even I, a digital copy editor, have to admit that you did a bang up job on that newspaper ad copy {0.SimFirstName}. Look, this doesn't change anything... print advertisement is still on the way out. With work like that though, my bosses may force me to keep contracting print freelancers for awhile longer. Ugh, just take your bonus and get out of here."</Text>
  <Text Key="223BF98B">"Oh honey, you did &lt;i&gt;so well&lt;/i&gt; on that newspaper ad! No seriously, &lt;i&gt;good job&lt;/i&gt;! It's really impressive in this day and age to find people still committed to working in a print medium. Here's your money; ta-ta!"</Text>
  <Text Key="BC47D4D9">While {0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the agreed upon work on time, the intern that'd secretly hired {M0.him}{F0.her} had a failure of {M0.her}{F0.his} own... The intern's boss discovered that {M0.she'd}{F0.he'd} outsourced {M0.her}{F0.his} work, and immediately booted {M0.her}{F0.him} from the firm's office. Thankfully, the marketing firm ended up having to pay {0.SimFirstName} a prorated amount for the work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} done to avoid infringing upon labor laws.</Text>
  <Text Key="7AF3ED4D">"{0.SimFirstName} this ad campaign is brilliant! Way better than my original scratch 'n sniff idea. The client was thrilled, my boss was satisfied... Best of all, the firm offered me a full time job! You're talking to a Marketing Assistant I now! I'm so grateful... here, take my signing bonus as an extra thank you.!"</Text>
  <Text Key="20EE9DC6">The marketing intern expressed {M0.her}{F0.his} thanks and gratitude. {0.SimFirstName}'s work on the magazine campaign arrived just in the nick of time; saving the intern from an embarrassing dismissal from {M0.her}{F0.his} temporary position at the firm.</Text>
  <Text Key="9ADB90C0">The marketing exec accused {0.SimFirstName} of lollygagging, as the submission deadline for the requested marketing copy had come and gone. Still, the exec was a {M0.woman}{F0.man} of {M0.her}{F0.his} word, and tossed {0.SimFirstName} some clams for the partial work {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} managed to complete.</Text>
  <Text Key="234FD3EC">The marketing execs are impressed at {0.SimFirstName}'s modern take on marketing copy. Not only did they decide to use the slogan {M0.he}{F0.she} ultimately submitted, but they think there's a lot of value in the off the cuff ideas {M0.he}{F0.she} dropped in their initial discussion... So much so, that they've decided to pay {M0.him}{F0.her} an additional bonus!</Text>
  <Text Key="926B435D">{0.SimFirstName}'s product slogan proved to be "just what the doctor ordered", according to the marketing exec. That poor exec seems stuck in the past, a relic of the pre-digital age. {0.SimFirstName} can't imagine that marketing firm will be around much longer, but their money is still good for now, at least.</Text>
  <Text Key="CF3ABCA9">It appears that the one most disappointed by the failure to create a dating app was the {F0.boyfriend}{M0.girlfriend} of the one that put up the job posting. Who also turned out to be the president of the company. {0.SimFirstName} was paid a percentage of the contract amount out of spite.</Text>
  <Text Key="0190E9DD">The dating world has just been rocked. The client insists that {0.SimFirstName} is the Cupid of modern society, whatever that means. No matter, {F0.she}{M0.he} received more than the agreed payment, so no complaints!</Text>
  <Text Key="60AB9236">A dating app isn't the easiest piece of software to make, but {0.SimFirstName} managed to get it done on time. The company representative was delighted for a while, but then learned that their significant other has started using it... Best look the other way.</Text>
  <Text Key="A8193034">"We could be sending each other smiley faces and animated hugs right now!"\n\n{0.SimFirstName} received some very angry text messages about failing to deliver. Then, possibly fearing the messages would be publicized, the company representative sent an apology and a small portion of the contract pay.</Text>
  <Text Key="C015D868">{0.SimFirstName} delivered the app so fast, the client was able time it with the release of a highly anticipated new phone. This pushed downloads through the roof! The client decided to share a bit of the initial profits with {0.SimFirstName} a nice bonus.</Text>
  <Text Key="AE1FB6E9">As soon as {0.SimFirstName} sent the finished app over, {F0.she}{M0.he} started receiving stickers from the client. It was fun at first, but the constant flow of reaction GIFs and emotes is getting very tiring. At least the pay was nice.</Text>
  <Text Key="471369AB">The client was very disappointed that {0.SimFirstName} had nothing to show. Apparently, they are running low on funds as it is. Still, the client gave a small percentage of the pay hoping that the good deed will mean things will turn around for them soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="FF6EBAE7">The client was very nice, and intensely driven. They had a complete launch plan ready, with soft launches and marketing beats. So when {0.SimFirstName} delivered the game ahead of schedule, the entrepreneur almost didn't know what to do. After a bit of freaking out, they added a bonus to the final payment.</Text>
  <Text Key="EC5A4A34">The game was delivered on time, much to the appreciation of the client. They've been expecting everything to go wrong, like they always do. {0.SimFirstName} is happy for {F0.him}{M0.her} but really wishes that {F0.he}{M0.she} would stop asking to be friends.</Text>
  <Text Key="9C8BD08E">Surprisingly, the client was not upset at all that {0.SimFirstName} failed to deliver. According to the representative, the company has hundreds of these projects going all the time, expecting a few to drop here and there. A prorated amount was paid to thank {0.SimFirstName} for {F0.her}{M0.his} time. Business as usual, it seems.</Text>
  <Text Key="2D39A4D2">The client knew exactly what they wanted, and {0.SimFirstName} delivered. The result was fantastic, and earned a top spot in that company's hall of fame. This earned {F0.her}{M0.him} a hefty bonus!</Text>
  <Text Key="1F96588F">The client knew what they wanted, and {0.SimFirstName} gave it to them. It was drowned out by the other 20 games that company released at around the same time, but {F0.she}{M0.he} still got paid.</Text>
  <Text Key="1DA68E20">Well, they did say they would pay anyone that participates. Even late and unfinished, the organizers gave {0.SimFirstName} the "You Tried Prize" as they called it. Where &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; they getting this money?</Text>
  <Text Key="B47EF14C">Well, that was quite fast. The organizers complimented {0.SimFirstName} on a speedy delivery, claiming it's rare that such a quickly made mod works so seamlessly with the original game. Apparently, that's worth a bonus! Where do they get all this money...?</Text>
  <Text Key="7BA5ED3D">It sure is a mod... for a game... Yep. With all the criteria satisfied, {0.SimFirstName} received the promised payment. The organizers couldn't help but express a little disappointment at the bugginess of the mod, but it was a tight deadline after all.</Text>
  <Text Key="4F731AF5">{0.SimFirstName} didn't give the modding group anything complete, but they still gave a small portion of the promised pay out of good will. They said something about modders needing to support each other. What a nice bunch!</Text>
  <Text Key="A0F56D71">The mod was very timely delivered. The modding group was so relieved that they gave {0.SimFirstName} a bit extra! Now everyone can enjoy their vacations in peace. Sort of. Unfortunately, the missing modder still hasn't been heard from...</Text>
  <Text Key="A9AFAFFA">The mod was delivered, and after a bit of testing and verification, released to the community. High fives all around! Well, virtual high fives, since everyone works remotely. The modding group thanked {0.SimFirstName} for {F0.her}{M0.his} help and continued their vacations. Now about that missing modder...</Text>
  <Text Key="8CB6C65A">“I don’t think you’re cut out for this ‘Self-Employed’ craze I’m about to bring to the world. You didn’t follow steps four through seven yourself, failing to meet the goals we set. Just remember steps twenty nine and seventy two {0.SimFirstName}, they’ll help you bounce back from this setback but only if you put your mind to it. I’m forwarding pay for what you did finish; it will help me inspire someone better suited to motivating themselves.”</Text>
  <Text Key="DD7C13C6">“This book hits the nail on the head! People really needed to not only learn to see the opportunities around them but also understand the problems they’d face pursuing their new path of self-employment! For all your work, I’m giving you a cut of the signing bonus the publisher offered. You’re the embodiment of my philosophy on self-employment. It’s almost like you took all my ideas to heart.”</Text>
  <Text Key="CDBBAE33">Upon reformatting the last of the client’s incoherent thoughts on employment, {0.SimFirstName} submitted the final draft and sat back. Almost immediately, the client messaged back, pleased with the overall work. Once they finished reading everything over once more the book would be off to the publisher and then into the hands of the masses. {0.SimFirstName} was about to influence many to reach for their dreams of being self-employed.</Text>
  <Text Key="46A87A53">Upon reading the draft work {0.SimFirstName} had been working on, the client found themselves compelled to complete the book on their own. In this way, {0.SimFirstName} inspired and motivated someone... just at the expense of the contract. {F0.She}{M0.He} will be compensated for the work they've done so far, however.</Text>
  <Text Key="1A007FAF">"Oh wow, why didn't I think of this? It's brilliant! I'm going to go start my next book right now!" the client said of the writing {0.SimFirstName} did in helping finish the motivational book. Having inspired the motivational speaker to take the next steps, the book itself does very well!</Text>
  <Text Key="3BF0074C">{0.SimFirstName} got a good review on the motivational book, the client calling it "more than adequate" as {F0.she}{M0.he} helped push it over the finish line.</Text>
  <Text Key="BEF419F8">The client mysteriously ended the contract with {0.SimFirstName} after the first outline was sent off. With no feedback, {F0.she}{M0.he} thinks it best to let the mystery rest for now. At least {F0.she}{M0.he} got a small paycheck out of it.</Text>
  <Text Key="DAFCCD84">{0.SimFirstName} wrote a treatise on the song, analyzing the harmonic patterns, checking to see if the notes spelled any words, and digging through so many old files. The public responded well to {F0.her}{M0.his} findings, riveted by every word -- even though it raised more questions than it answered.</Text>
  <Text Key="B8C84285">{0.SimFirstName} searched and searched, studying the sheet music and finding the names of the companies that distributed it. Turning over all the same stones previous investigations did, {F0.she}{M0.he} didn't manage to find any new information, but did present it in a new way.</Text>
  <Text Key="808CBECD">The only crime committed here is the writing, or so the client says. {0.SimFirstName}'s initial drafts were found wanting. {F0.She}{M0.He} will still get paid for the first part of the contract, but has been asked not to contrive any other capers for them at the moment.</Text>
  <Text Key="6EDB9569">The series is selling so well it feels like stealing. {0.SimFirstName} received a series of accolades and more than a few quirked eyebrows wondering if {F0.she}{M0.he} has been thinking about how to build {F0.her}{M0.his} criminal empire long before taking this gig...</Text>
  <Text Key="39B2B422">The caper and the crime have been committed; {0.SimFirstName} sent off the manuscript and the client thought it was a "good start," and are happy with what {F0.she}{M0.he} crafted for them.</Text>
  <Text Key="B4248216">The deadline passed, the criminal got away and the client pulled the plug. Though {0.SimFirstName} was compensated for {F0.her}{M0.his} time with the investigation, {F0.she}{M0.he} didn’t feel satisfied. The puzzle was incomplete, the tale went cold. Surly it couldn’t stop here! But it would, and {0.SimFirstName} would have to return to their other mundane writings for now. For even the best sometimes get lost in the fog.</Text>
  <Text Key="E023E71A">The case was closed; Sleuths and Scofflaws had their cover story. The narrative was inventive; the criminal inspired. Now was time for silent reflection and a juice, straight. Suddenly, a notification appeared on the screen the author kept in the corner of {F0.her}{M0.his} eye. With a single press of a button the notice illuminated the virtual landscape before them. Gratuity from Slater Publishing, most appreciated, told of a client well satisfied. In a post script, an ask to delve into another conundrum. But {0.SimFirstName} needed {F0.her}{M0.his} rest. Time to calm the mind before burrowing back into the muck and grime of another investigation.</Text>
  <Text Key="C8B460E7">Slater Publishing was happy with the narrative {0.SimFirstName} provided. A solid crime thriller with a compelling protagonist. Now {0.SimFirstName} just needed to wait for the story to be published to see how much the masses enjoyed the mystery.</Text>
  <Text Key="9B164B85">{0.SimFirstName} didn't write a text book so much as a stream of consciousness manuscript. The client makes a note of how it feels more like an opinion piece, and politely thanks {F0.her}{M0.him} for their help, but explains they will take it from here.</Text>
  <Text Key="4CDDA941">The client is elated with the history text book, and so are the schools it'll be used in. Grades across the district are up, test scores are improving, and the students have a new appreciation for history. {0.SimFirstName} didn't just do a good job, they helped society remember where they came from!</Text>
  <Text Key="CF7A16AA">"Did you remember to go over &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the notes?" the client asked over and over. After reading through the drafts and finalizing the text book, the schools happily distribute the new text book.</Text>
  <Text Key="90B10130">Unable to make heads or tails of who the client was talking about as it went from first, to third, back to second-perspective in his writings, the contract was canceled out of frustration. A paltry sum of simoleons was still paid out however.</Text>
  <Text Key="CC412F5C">{0.SimFirstName} reworked the drafts, tied the ideas together, and maybe learned a little about the philosophy of perspective and existence! The client was very, very pleased with himself. Or pleased with {0.SimFirstName}, depending on perspective.</Text>
  <Text Key="BFA9D9AD">{0.SimFirstName} took the draft and corrected it, fixing the portions that were written in stream-of-consciousness, fixing the perspective from second to third, and turning the first-person lines into quotes. {F0.She}{M0.He} still isn't sure {F0.she}{M0.he} understands the philosophical implications, but the client is happy!</Text>
  <Text Key="A87B0297">Failing to meet the project deadline, {0.SimFirstName} got a heavily self-censored email from their irate client. Seems the deadline was to get the work published and missing this has greatly affected the client’s standing in the scientific community. Though {0.SimFirstName} got paid for {F0.her}{M0.his} time, it wasn’t the full contracted amount.</Text>
  <Text Key="37FE36EB">“Exemplary! it’s almost like writing for nitwi… non-scientific individuals is your calling. I must say, translating the absence of privileged reference frames in general relativity into something palatable for a five-year old must be some sort of cabalistic gift! Next time I’m in need of a writer, I’ll be sure to reach out. Oh, I’ve included something extra for your marvelous work.”</Text>
  <Text Key="78809218">“This partnership has been rather satisfactory. Normally, I dread dealing directly with dolti… the general public. The Scientific Research Publication should be shipping out our work in the next few weeks and expect it to become a standard text-book in my field.”</Text>
  <Text Key="1AE72912">{0.SimFirstName} just sort of wrote whatever came to mind during the long periods of silence when working with the guru. Finding the results unsatisfactory, the client suggested that {F0.she}{M0.he} find their peace and happiness elsewhere, paying a portion of the agreed amount.</Text>
  <Text Key="AF7C3CBE">{0.SimFirstName} took notes, writing down the events of the guru's experiences and thoughts on inner peace. A little bit of enlightenment must have rubbed off on {F0.her}{M0.him} because the client was very happy with the results.</Text>
  <Text Key="211D1F1B">Writing a by the numbers, literal interpretation of the events and thoughts the guru spoke to, {0.SimFirstName} completed the work to light praise.</Text>
  <Text Key="42DCDE6C">The politician is pretty unhappy that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the assigned tasks by the agreed upon time. {M0.She'll}{F0.He'll} never admit it, but a proposal {M0.she}{F0.he} introduced to slash the public art budget seemed like a clear retaliatory response to {0.SimFirstName}'s lackadaisical approach to {M0.his}{F0.her} work.</Text>
  <Text Key="8DEB3DA0">A beautifully rendered portrait may just be the start of something bigger for {0.SimFirstName}... The politician is so pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} work that {M0.she's}{F0.he's} promised to share {0.SimFirstName}'s name to other up and coming public servants who need their own portraits painted. {M0.She}{F0.He} even diverted a little bonus from a slush fund {0.SimFirstName}'s way!</Text>
  <Text Key="B75CD111">The politician is quite pleased with the portrait {0.SimFirstName} created, and even expunged some jaywalking fines from {0.SimFirstName}'s record as a small sign of thanks.</Text>
  <Text Key="90C842C1">A cold chill ran through {0.SimFirstName}'s body, as the deadline for completing the portrait came and went. It seems the spirit realm is unhappy with {M0.his}{F0.her} lack of commitment to aiding in the remembrance of a family's loved one.</Text>
  <Text Key="592588D5">The client began to openly weep on receipt of the portrait... {0.SimFirstName} created such a lifelike rendering of their recently departed loved one, that they immediately felt a close bond to the painting. In fact, they swear that the eyes in the painting follow them each time they walk by. It's hard to put a price on what's sure to be a treasured item in the client's family, but they managed to do just that, when they expressed their thanks by paying {0.SimFirstName} a nice bonus on top of the portrait's agreed upon price.</Text>
  <Text Key="7D7855FE">The client was pleased to see the portrait of a departed loved one rendered so faithfully by {0.SimFirstName}. The restless spirit in question seemed quite appreciative as well, as {M0.she}{F0.he} popped out of {M0.her}{F0.his} urn to give a nod of approval. </Text>
  <Text Key="AD59002A">{0.SimFirstName}'s procrastination in completing the portrait gig did not pay off. It would seem the client passed away while waiting for {0.SimFirstName} to complete {M0.his}{F0.her} work. An estate lawyer did transfer a portion of the gig's payment for the work that {0.SimFirstName} did manage to complete.</Text>
  <Text Key="F44FAC16">{0.SimFirstName} submitted what could only be described as a stunning likeness of {M0.his}{F0.her} client, who was said to be so pleased that they hopped out of their deathbed and burst into an impromptu smustle. Pleasing an octogenarian has its benefits; the client included an extra bonus payment for a job well done.</Text>
  <Text Key="AEAE2323">With {M0.her}{F0.his} dying breath, the octogenarian transferred the agreed upon payment to {0.SimFirstName}'s account. Seems like {0.SimFirstName} finished the portrait just in the nick of time? RIP to them; hopefully their family enjoys the painting.</Text>
  <Text Key="7B26887D">“Hey, deadline’s passed. Got the ants to do some of the proofreading before submitting the paper since I never heard back from you. Just hoping they didn’t modify my notes to put them in a better light when I wasn’t looking. Payment for you time included.”</Text>

  <Text Key="8FC2DBD8">The Sims Transportation Administration is unhappy that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the gig's requirements within the allotted time. {M0.He}{F0.She} received some pay for the partial work completed, but don't be surprised if {M0.he}{F0.she} gets pulled out of the security line for a "random" pat down next time {M0.he}{F0.she} takes a flight.</Text>
  <Text Key="FB74BB64">The Sims Transportation Administration is thrilled with the mural that {0.SimFirstName} proposed, and can't wait until its brought to life within the airport terminal. Not only did {M0.he}{F0.she} earn bonus pay, but they all chipped in to buy {0.SimFirstName} a lifetime pass to the airport's first class lounge - how swanky!</Text>
  <Text Key="A30ECBE5">The Sims Transportation Administration is pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed airport terminal mural. On top of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay, they gave {M0.him}{F0.her} a coupon to skip the security line on {M0.his}{F0.her} next flight.</Text>
  <Text Key="5766792D">{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the submission process for the city's electrical box art program by the required deadline. As expected with any government contract though, {M0.he}{F0.she} still collected a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} expected payment.</Text>
  <Text Key="E46D5CC9">The city council board was radiating excitement over {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed electrical box art! They were effusive with their praise, and even the mayor {M0.herself}{F0.himself} shook {0.SimFirstName}'s hand in a photo op for the press.</Text>
  <Text Key="14AA2102">{0.SimFirstName} strode into City Hall with {M0.his}{F0.her} proposed electrical box art, looking forward to the opportunity to present {M0.his}{F0.her} vision for artwork on every city street corner. The reality was decidedly less exciting, as a government employee momentarily glanced at {0.SimFirstName}'s proposal before handing over a check. Oh well, at least the pay was good!</Text>
  <Text Key="1CC175F6">City Hall officials are disappointed that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to complete a proposal for a Main Street district in time. {M0.He}{F0.She} received a partial payment for completing a portion of the gig's goals.</Text>
  <Text Key="FD571EFA">City Hall officials are in such love with {0.SimFirstName}'s proposal for the Main Street district mural, that in addition to giving {M0.him}{F0.her} a bonus payment, they've taken the extraordinary step of renaming Main Street to {0.SimName} Boulevard!</Text>
  <Text Key="0D63CD47">City Hall officials are in unanimous agreement that {0.SimFirstName}'s proposed mural is the winner and will soon be created in the Main Street district. They've taken the step of installing an honorary plaque on a nearby bench bearing {M0.his}{F0.her} name.</Text>
  <Text Key="FF097084">Not all writing is gold. {0.SimName}'s approaches to enhance the story didn't make the cut. Their notes suggest that adding an abundance of pop-culture references don't make it more dystopian, but {F0.she}{M0.he} won't be discouraged. There's always the next gig, and the next series reboot.</Text>
  <Text Key="A1B2ADB8">{0.SimName} volunteered as tribute, taking the task of writing about the scrappy group's struggles against the evil empire to heart. After no less than 451 pages of scorching wordsmithing, {F0.she}{M0.he} took the series in a brand new, darker direction. Having done so well, {F0.she}{M0.he} left room for the heroes' new hope, but the government will strike back. The client may yet ask {F0.her}{M0.him} to return for another chapter!</Text>
  <Text Key="934B8519">{0.SimName} took all the elements of the dystopian, hopeless world and made the cold equations necessary to write a futuristic story of escaping the futuristic prison city of San Myshuno. The chapters went well, offering a near total recall of what made the series great to begin with. The client was impressed, and might bring {F0.her}{M0.him} back for the third in the series.</Text>

  <Text Key="6130A042">With the client still stuck on a few details of the world and publisher interest waning on the incomplete story, the client scrapped the idea believing they wouldn’t be able to finish the novel.

  <Text Key="42D6C4AE">“Bestseller”, that’s all the client kept repeating as {0.SimFirstName} finished their last meeting before the deadline. Nearly every publishing company was chomping at the bits to be the novel’s sole printer.  The client even wrote the entire foreword of the book thanking {F0.her}{M0.him} and noting their contributions to the tale. {0.SimFirstName} wasn’t at all shocked when {F0.she}{M0.he} saw the clients payment for {F0.her}{M0.his} work was much higher than the original agreed amount.</Text>
  <Text Key="BB8BEDEB">The collaboration between the client and {0.SimFirstName} end with a fantastic dive into the future. While the client’s initial idea wasn’t as unique as they hoped, the resulting work of fiction will definitely inspire other writers and scientist to dream of what could be just as other sci-fi stories have done before.</Text>
  <Text Key="1F5A2B43">{0.SimFirstName} didn't complete all of the gig's goals in time, and is lucky that the courthouse judge didn't declare {M0.him}{F0.her} as being in contempt of court. Thankfully, {M0.he}{F0.she} still received a partial payment; but don't be surprised if {M0.he's}{F0.she's} "randomly" selected for jury duty soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="00A39B1F">The judge was so pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s work, that {M0.she}{F0.he} allowed {0.SimFirstName} to act as an honorary bailiff and announce {M0.her}{F0.his} entrance to courtroom. What a thrill! The bonus pay was certainly a nice reward as well.</Text>
  <Text Key="6B755D1C">The court was pleased with {0.SimFirstName}'s skills, and immediately put {M0.him}{F0.her} to work documenting a significant case. It turns out that the job came with the additional perk of having {M0.his}{F0.her} name removed from the jury duty pool; not bad!</Text>
  <Text Key="88E928CA">The poet that hired {0.SimFirstName} was upset that {0.SimFirstName} didn't complete {M0.his}{F0.her} tasks on time to be able to accompany {M0.her}{F0.him} to the slam poetry session. {M0.She}{F0.He} had an emotional breakdown when realizing {M0.she}{F0.he} still had to pay for the portion of work {0.SimFirstName} did manage to complete, which was followed by a promise to use {M0.her}{F0.his} time on stage to slam {0.SimFirstName} with an excoriating takedown.</Text>
  <Text Key="4A3E11B6">{0.SimFirstName}'s time spent with the poet for an impromptu jam session was absolutely sublime. Words flowed seamlessly from {M0.her}{F0.his} mouth and onto {0.SimFirstName}'s sketch pad. {0.SimFirstName} even earned some bonus cash during their session from passersby who mistook their act as a street performance.</Text>
  <Text Key="143B1C43">{0.SimFirstName}'s time spent with the poet went well enough. {M0.He}{F0.She} may not exactly "get" slam poetry, but as long as the client's money is good, {0.SimFirstName} is happy to keep sketching along to {M0.her}{F0.his} verbal fever dreams.</Text>
  <Text Key="58FAB9E1">The police department paid {0.SimFirstName} a prorated rate for {M0.his}{F0.her} time, but were disappointed that {M0.he}{F0.she} was unable to complete the job by their deadline.</Text>
  <Text Key="15D0D3F5">{0.SimFirstName}'s forensic sketch work led to the direct capture of the head of an organized crime ring within an hour of it being posted to the most wanted list! The police department was so thrilled, that they even let {M0.him}{F0.her} redline a police cruiser with the siren blaring. What a day!</Text>
  <Text Key="C8AC899E">{0.SimFirstName}'s forensic sketch work showed a lot of promise. Within an hour of {M0.his}{F0.her} composite sketch being posted to the most wanted database, the police department received multiple tips to follow up on. Fingers crossed that it'll lead to getting more bad guys off the streets.</Text>
  <Text Key="60D1185A">{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete all of his tasks on time; it looks like the video game will ship with bland loading screens after all. Something as simple as a loading screen can't be enough to affect the game's review scores though... right? Well, whatever -- {0.SimFirstName} will be on to {M0.his}{F0.her} next gig long before then.</Text>
  <Text Key="0B4EA5C6">In a sardonic text message, the game's producer told {0.SimFirstName}, &lt;i&gt;"I've got over 99,999 problems, but loading screens aren't one."&lt;/i&gt; {0.SimFirstName} smiled, having been accepted into the inner circle of the development team as someone trustworthy for them to commiserate with. As a sign of thanks, the producer made a small gesture and named a character in the game after {0.SimFirstName}, as well as awarding {M0.him}{F0.her} with a small bonus payment for {M0.his}{F0.her} outstanding work.</Text>
  <Text Key="04C7B433">{0.SimFirstName}'s loading screen art is a success! The game's beta testers are transfixed by the gorgeous on-screen art, and no longer seem to mind the loading they're enduring each time they play. Oddly enough, the top request after {0.SimFirstName}'s art was patched in was for the addition of a loading screen progress bar, so players knew how long they had to enjoy the imagery before being returned to the game.</Text>
  <Text Key="1AC2CC53">{0.SimFirstName} failed to complete the concert venue poster tasks in time to receive a full payment. A voice mail left on {M0.his}{F0.her} phone said everything {M0.he}{F0.she} needed to know about how the band felt... {M0.He}{F0.She} heard something along the lines of, "loser square art nerd" before {M0.he}{F0.she} just hung up.</Text>
  <Text Key="47D311AF">The band LOVES {0.SimFirstName}'s work; ticket sales for the concert are already trending upwards and pointing towards a swift sellout. Not only did they include a bonus payment, they've invited {0.SimFirstName} to come chill on the tour bus before the show!</Text>
  <Text Key="72FC0D4C">The band is digging {0.SimFirstName}'s work! The concert poster looks, in their words, "sick". The lead singer let {M0.him}{F0.her} know that there are some extra tickets to the show waiting for him in the will call booth.</Text>
  <Text Key="6C6D351C">{0.SimFirstName} missed {M0.his}{F0.her} deadline for completing work on the indie film's poster, forcing the director to turn to a marketing agency to have a poster finished in time for the Del Sol Valley Film Fest. An angry voicemail left on {0.SimFirstName}'s phone had the director screaming how {0.SimFirstName} would never find work in this town again, but honestly {M0.she}{F0.he} seems like a bit of a blowhard...</Text>
  <Text Key="C9A13890">{0.SimFirstName}'s indie film poster immediately resonated with movie goers looking to attend the Del Sol Valley Film Fest, as they started clamoring for copies of the poster to be made available for purchase. Recognizing the added revenue that {0.SimFirstName}'s work will bring in, the film's producer authorized a bonus payment to be deposited directly in {0.SimFirstName}'s bank account.</Text>
  <Text Key="FCCC00A1">In addition to delivering a compelling indie film poster, {0.SimFirstName} took the time to make up some nonsense about the symbolism of the imagery that {M0.he}{F0.she} included. Predictably, the film's director was enraptured by the care {0.SimFirstName} appeared to have taken to represent the film's vision. Another satisfied client!</Text>
  <Text Key="94D4BD25">It seems {0.SimFirstName} also doesn't know how spreadsheets work. Either that, or {F0.she}{M0.he} underestimated the amount of work. Either way, the small business owner was pretty upset. It's a good thing they don't know how to file a formal complaint, so {0.SimFirstName} still received a small amount of pay.</Text>
  <Text Key="5C3F79E1">The small business owner was so amazed at the efficiency and organization offered to {F0.him}{M0.her}, it was like a whole new world was now open. Given how fast the job was done, the owner is now convinced that computers are the way of the future. {F0.He}{M0.She} even sent {0.SimFirstName} a care package of their best products, whatever they are.</Text>
  <Text Key="2C1A9ECA">The small business owner was amazed, but very confused at the door now open to {F0.him}{M0.her}. No more stacks of boxes full of inventory forms, no more digging for reference numbers. Now if only {F0.he}{M0.she} would stop breaking the formulas and accidentally coloring in cells...</Text>
  <Text Key="8A6F72D0">The client was devastated that {0.SimFirstName} was unable to finish the work on time, but still gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a portion of the pay out of politeness. Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} also needs to take a good look at {F0.herself}{M0.himself}.</Text>
  <Text Key="F4EE21FC">Once the completed spreadsheet was delivered, the client claimed that it was like a mountain was lifted from {F0.her}{M0.his} shoulders. What could {F0.she}{M0.he} possibly be doing that {F0.her}{M0.his} life would be so affected by a spreadsheet? The client gave {0.SimFirstName} a bonus as special thanks for how fast the job was completed.</Text>
  <Text Key="C39224CD">The client was overjoyed with the prepared spreadsheet. The formulas were all functional, the filters were all in place, and the cells were almost artistically spaced. {0.SimFirstName} received congratulations for a job well done!</Text>
  <Text Key="0BF4D920">Maybe {0.SimFirstName}'s conscience got the better of {F0.her}{M0.him}. Maybe {F0.she}{M0.he} just isn't good with making malicious software. Either way, the totally safe and legal company paid a small amount to keep {F0.her}{M0.him} quiet.</Text>
  <Text Key="E56B9C4C">The speed that {0.SimFirstName} finished those viruses actually intimidated even the less than angelic company. Clearly, they're dealing with a malware professional, and need to be careful. Still, a job well done needs to be rewarded, and the company added a decent bonus on top of the payment.</Text>
  <Text Key="6D06E63D">{0.SimFirstName} completed the job and delivered those viruses. {F0.She}{M0.He} doesn't need to know what that company wants to use them for. Things will be fine! Perfectly fine, as long as the money transaction goes through. You can't wire dirty money, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="3DC165F5">The antivirus company wasn't pleased that {0.SimFirstName} couldn't deliver anything to help with their research, but still gave a portion of the pay as they don't blame anyone for "not wanting to fall to the dark" as they said.</Text>
  <Text Key="D1E21871">The antivirus company was thrilled with the speed and diligence of {0.SimFirstName}'s work. They wanted to send {F0.her}{M0.him} a medal, but {F0.she}{M0.he} insisted that the payment would be enough. Eventually, they settled on a decently sized bonus. Everyone is happy!</Text>
  <Text Key="9B10A8FA">{0.SimFirstName} is doing {F0.her}{M0.his} part in making the world a safer place. At least, that's what the antivirus company keeps saying in their correspondence. That's nice and all, but the pay is even better! </Text>
  <Text Key="E0DBD99E">The shady individual didn't enjoy the news that {0.SimFirstName} couldn't provide the promised viruses. Still, the mysterious persona claimed that they were going to be rich soon anyway, so they still paid a modest amount for the time spent.</Text>
  <Text Key="7628D562">So it turns out SimCoin is real, and actively traded. It took an amazingly short amount of time for the client to report finding their first SimCoin. Thanking {0.SimFirstName} for the speed of {F0.her}{M0.his} delivery, the anonymous individual transferred over the payment with a nice bonus on top.</Text>
  <Text Key="14372E3F">"Any day now!" The hopeful cryptominer was pleased with the delivery of the viruses, and immediately set to work. {0.SimFirstName} received {F0.her}{M0.his} payment and tried {F0.her}{M0.his} best to ignore the increasingly desperate updates the client keeps sending.</Text>
  <Text Key="F9784ABC">{0.SimFirstName} couldn't deliver the promised website by the deadline, so the project was canceled. Trying to maintain the image of a real business, the e-commerce startup paid a prorated amount for the time spent on the project.</Text>
  <Text Key="77F5A030">After {0.SimFirstName}'s website was approved, the e-commerce startup immediately got to work. Turns out, they're actually very competent and the website caught on. For {F0.her}{M0.his} speedy completion of the job, the company gave {F0.her}{M0.him} a small portion of their initial sales as a bonus!</Text>
  <Text Key="145B81C1">Adding another e-commerce website into the abyss is a risky business strategy. Still, the company launched {0.SimFirstName}'s work and released it to the world. Only time will tell if it is successful.</Text>
  <Text Key="52DD5E91">Given that the job posting seemed unintentional, {0.SimFirstName} was surprised that the client seemed very upset when it wasn't finished. {F0.She}{M0.He} was even more surprised when {F0.she}{M0.he} received a payment anyway. It's a small amount, but it's better than nothing!</Text>
  <Text Key="4167BA65">The seemingly accidental job posting turned out to be for a highly anticipated product. The speedy completion of the landing pages helped the organization of the marketing plan immensely, and {0.SimFirstName} was given a nice bonus for {F0.her}{M0.his} efforts.</Text>
  <Text Key="126DE1AE">Sometimes the best things in life come from accidents. This turned out to be one of them. The client was very pleased with the completion of the job, and wrote a very nice recommendation for {0.SimFirstName}. It can't really be used because it was obviously written with voice to text, but it's the thought that counts.</Text>
  <Text Key="CE54D7FA">"We're never going to experience the future with this kind of work..."\n\nIt was harsh to hear, but it's true. Not finishing the job is bad enough, but it's devastating to such visionaries. {0.SimFirstName} managed to work out a deal of a prorated amount of pay by using these words.</Text>
  <Text Key="F4033166">The movers and shakers of the modern world might speak in a strange way, but they know what they're doing. Very appreciative of {0.SimFirstName}'s quick turnaround, the company rewarded {F0.her}{M0.him} with a very nice bonus, as well as a promise that {F0.she}{M0.he} has helped change the world.</Text>
  <Text Key="53474053">Talking to this client might get on {0.SimFirstName}'s nerves, but a job is a job. Completing all of {F0.her}{M0.his} tasks on time in the face of overwhelming pretentiousness is the mark of a true professional!</Text>

  <Text Key="552EB1AA">East Shore Chateau sat abandoned for years. A brisk jaunt from the beach and surrounded by thick vegetation, its interior smelled of jungle musk, decaying mahogany, and sea air. Various species of vibrantly plumed birds and neon specked frogs called its dilapidated remains home. Few locals who remained on the island remembered the mystery surrounding its downfall—even fewer still spoke of it.\n\nIt was inevitable that when Mason Lupoe bought the mansion, it would cause quite a stir...</Text>

  <Text Key="9B5FAF39">The closest form of civilization to East Shore Chateau was a small coastal fishing village. The community watched from afar as Mason Lupoe first purchased the estate and soon after began repairs. The sounds of saws and hammers echoed through the dense surrounding jungle, washed out by the nearby waves breaking against the beach. Then one day... nothing.\n\nNo sim came or went from East Shore Chateau, and it remained disturbingly quiet as weeks stretched on. Mason Lupoe, himself, was declared missing. Investigators and anyone looking into the disappearances also seemed to vanish in the shadow cast by East Shore. It was at that point, the community made a decision. The estate was to be torn down from the outside in.\n\nAnd so it was done. Plank by plank, window by window, the estate was dismantled—its fine furnishing and trim re-purposed around the island. The doors were sold in an auction. It is said... that on humid summer nights the doors can be heard sliding open and closed as the spirits of those missing pass through.</Text>

  <Text Key="C5C4C8EA">One thing Princess Cordelia simply couldn’t fit on her submersible was her beloved jazz band. She so missed the music of her former life that she painted a series of pictures to commemorate it. This lively number was inspired by the sax legend Jacob Goldentips, who was left tragically adrift during The Great Sloth Invasion.</Text>

  <Text Key="D7672E70">Ode to Jazz 2: “Goldentips”</Text>
  <Text Key="DCB10528">Even a submersible as grand as the Eppsilon has its limitations. Princess Cordelia had to cast out many employees, including her beloved jazz band. She longed for their music so deeply that she painted a series of pictures as a tribute. This silhouette portrays bass player Martin Maxwell still playing in the depths of the sea. So poignant! </Text>
  <Text Key="7C04FD47">Ode to Jazz 3: “Sea Bass”</Text>
  <Text Key="F508B893">When The Great Sloth Invasion forced Princess Cordelia to flee, she simply couldn’t fit everyone on her submersible. But firing her beloved jazz band remained a regret so sharp, she painted a series of pictures to honor them. This wistful silhouette portrays one of her musicians still playing blues in the deep blue (purplish) sea. </Text>

  <Text Key="D36F024A">Blue for the Blues Wall Painting  </Text>
  <Text Key="A8C0E485">Princess Cordelia loved piano most of all. Though she had cut her jazz band adrift during her escape from her kingdom, she continued to ache for their music, and so found herself painting instruments. The piano keys in this tribute seem to arch up toward the light, almost as if lifted by the current. Apt, isn’t it?</Text>
  <Text Key="155F0E80">Ode to Jazz 5: “Ivory”</Text>
  <Text Key="BA6DC85A">Great jazz is hard to come by, especially in the depths of the sea, so Princess Cordelia commissioned a mute reproduction of glorious jazz music. </Text>

  <Text Key="B5500023">One thing the Princess was thrilled to leave back in her former kingdom was cats. They shed everywhere and made her sneeze! But nostalgia is a funny thing, and so the princess found herself painting them. As you can tell from this design, her portrayals were a touch romantic.</Text>
  <Text Key="819461F2">Jazz Cats: Whiskers of a Forgotten Past</Text>
  <Text Key="09B7FF38">Some days, the thought of her long-lost jazz musicians was simply too much for Princess Cordelia to bear. She even went so far as to have new instruments made, but with no one to play them, all she could do was paint pictures of them.</Text>
  <Text Key="FEA49D37">Ode to Jazz 6: “Ghost Quartet”</Text>
  <Text Key="52C5B1D9">Just like music, art can be a celebration-of things we love, of experiences we adore, of people left behind. This abstract painting is a beautiful reverie, a nostalgic tribute to the ne’er-to-be-forgotten performances of years past.</Text>
  <Text Key="13D4B05C">Etude in Blue</Text>
  <Text Key="C97E2E2E">Not all of Princess Cordelia’s entertainers perished in the Great Sloth Invasion. This pianist knew that if his body was to perish, his name must live on for him. So, he rolled his piano out atop the submersible and played until it went under.</Text>
  <Text Key="69B514D1">The Pianist</Text>
  <Text Key="11D98347">Princess Cordelia painted this before gradually fleeing from the giant sloths. Photographs were not commonplace yet, so this painting was all she had to remind her of her old palace’s painting studio. While sitting comfortably on her escape submarine, she changed the name from “Flower Still Life,” to “Land-Coral Garden.”</Text>
  <Text Key="973B90FE">Land-Coral Garden</Text>
  <Text Key="82160C22">Of course, there were no flowers in Princess Cordelia’s subaquatic life, but she had an acute memory of the vases and vases of them that once adorned the Royal House. Oh, the fragrance! Princess Cordelia couldn’t replicate the scent of course, but her painting was quite lifelike.</Text>

With her arrival, the Crows awoke and recounted how excited her children were for the new year.\n\nAs they were leaving, the Pig retrieved a metallic object from a mantle and offered, "I have nothing of value that matches the good fortune I've had tonight save for this heirloom, so I wish to pass that luck to you in gratitude." The Crows left with a promise to visit again soon.\n\nAt their nest, the Crows examined the sycee quizzically for a while, and tried prying it open. Unsuccessful, there was a moment of silence... and finally sudden laughter and exclamation: "Oh, it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a bowl with food or drink inside!"</Text>

This year, the new year arrived without the honored animal.\n\nThe Pig arrived near the party's end and sat at a table in quiet embarrassment, noticed by the Goat. With all red envelopes gifted and food eaten, the Goat plucked a kumquat from a potted citrus tree and offered half to the Pig. She accepted with relief and explained she could not find anyone to care for her piglets until friendly Crows returned to her farm. With the Goat's understanding and help with introductions, the Pig's embarrassment melted away to happiness during the remaining festivities.\n\nThe celebration ended at sunrise, and the Goat accompanied the Pig home. They decided their children should meet and exchange panda toys as friends, just as they had become.\n\nIt is okay to be last and late. Good friends will wait for you.</Text>

He did not receive an invitation, and thought it disrespectful of him to join the party.\n\nHe soon left and wandered to the riverside. Among the bamboo reeds along the water's edge, he sighed so loudly, a river spirit heard his cry. “Why so forlorn?” the spirit asked. At the end of the Panda's tale, the spirit told the Panda, “I will not allow you to be forgotten…”  Moonlight bathed the Panda, and the surrounding bamboo reeds sprouted buds in the shape of little pandas.\n\nLater, children plucked the panda-shaped bamboo, painted them with favorite colors at home, and shared them with other children. Somewhere else, the Panda smiled, and continued chewing a bamboo stalk.</Text>

  <Text Key="0AC38271">People always ask us how we are able to make such a narrow window at such high quality. The answer is simple! When we program our assembly line robots to make windows, we set both “narrow” and “high quality” to true!</Text>
  <Text Key="153A7C44">Mega Window (Deluxe)</Text>
  <Text Key="FE642D44">Add an air of old world charm with an eye-catching, mission-style arched window.</Text>
  <Text Key="E6CEDF0B">Old Meets View</Text>
  <Text Key="F755C90B">At MegaMission Outdoor Warehouse, every one of our antique windows and doors is made by hand by assembly line robots. Now, thanks to a slight error in a recursive function in their deluxe window-crafting program, we have produced thousands of high quality double windows. Some of the greatest inventions were born from simple errors!</Text>
  <Text Key="6CD6758A">Mega Window (Double Deluxe)</Text>
  <Text Key="4CC5FB26">It turns out that robots are incredibly good at breaking glass. When we realized our assembly line robots smashed 30% of the windows they constructed, we found a simple solution: program them to feel deep shame whenever they break a window. Now we get beauties like this Grand Mega Window without so much as a chip in the glass!</Text>
  <Text Key="A6451B39">Mega Window (Grand)</Text>
  <Text Key="452658FF">We asked the AI for our assembly line robots how it could construct a window that was twice as good as the Grand Mega Window, and it produced this in reply. We’re still not sure if it was being sarcastic or not.</Text>
  <Text Key="616B6426">Mega Window (Double Grand)</Text>
  <Text Key="B74CF495">Robots have difficulty with the concept of human excess, but we were able to work around that by swapping their definitions for “efficient” and “inefficient.” Now our window-crafting bots have been able to manufacture our grandest window yet, the Mega Window Grand Deluxe!</Text>
  <Text Key="E8E994B0">Mega Window (Grand Deluxe)</Text>
  <Text Key="FEFE6F68">This dramatic architectural feature is both arresting and appreciated.</Text>

  <Text Key="0B15C377">Mega Window (Budget DeLuxe)</Text>
  <Text Key="E7BBFEE5">For the budget-conscious consumer with a taste for antiques, we offer the Budget DeLite version of our popular Mega Window. Carved from discarded holiday trees that we buy in bulk, each window features 6 panes of Glaz, our semi-transparent glass substitute.</Text>
  <Text Key="E7CA1460">Mega Window (Budget DeLite)</Text>
  <Text Key="6DB02D87">What’s that you say? Six panes of Glaz aren’t enough? You want even more of our proprietary glass substitute in your antique window? Well say no more. We had our assembly line robots stick two Mega Windows together using the finest wood glue on the market. Now you can show all the neighbors that you’re a twelve-paner!</Text>
  <Text Key="0C287C3E">Mega Window (Double Budget DeLite)</Text>
  <Text Key="5F8C3E4F">This window is the result of a design challenge. We asked our assembly line robots to produce something that would let in as little light as possible but still be considered a “window” by human standards. Despite the rather subjective requirements of the test they did quite well!</Text>
  <Text Key="69E59B16">Mega Window (Cloverleaf)</Text>
  <Text Key="CF323D30">99.9% of our antique windows are mass produced on our assembly line; however, as a special promotion, we had an actual human artisan come in and hand carve 100 Mega Windows. We won’t tell you which ones are his, but if you buy enough to cover your house there’s a good chance you get at least one, right?</Text>

  <Text Key="0B87FECF">The Craftsman</Text>
  <Text Key="3103985F">We wanted a window that would practically scream “handmade antique.” That’s why we programmed our battery of assembly line robots to add a quaint wooden shutter to our popular Mega Window. You won’t believe the hands that made it were 40% tungsten!</Text>
  <Text Key="95968006">Mega Window (Shutter)</Text>
  <Text Key="5AE33406">Thanks to an error that flipped the blueprint image we scanned into the database of our assembly line robots, we have manufactured thousands of windows with the shutter attached to the wrong side. Use with our original shuttered Mega Window to create a nice symmetrical look.</Text>
  <Text Key="5D692D99">Mega Window (Reverse Shutter)</Text>
  <Text Key="B96F13EA">We produced this window by combining the plans for all of our other Mega Windows. It’s pretty good quality, a great size, decently attractive… It’s not necessarily everything you want but it’s certainly none of the things that you don’t want! Buy dozens!</Text>

Of course, you can change your boost at any time. Just call me and ask for another.\n\nI have three options! You can improve your gardening and cooking skill gain – yum yum!

No worries, I can reduce your hunger and hygiene decay. So, what’ll it be?

  <Text Key="E10461AA">Hmm, this is a little disturbing. {0.SimFirstName} thought that would help. The next symptom of Space Madness is paranoia and bad decision-making. Why didn't the fresh air tank help? It must have been a conspiracy!! {0.SimFirstName} needs to deal with this right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="40BD09A0">Hoping {M0.his}{F0.her} allergies stay under control, {0.SimFirstName} lunges into the hissing mob and gropes about wildly. Pain shoots up {M0.his}{F0.her} arm as {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers close around a wriggling, velvety beast. Success! {M0.He}{F0.She} wrangles the animal into the ship and thrusts it into a iron cage. {0.SimFirstName} can’t wait to see what they’ll make of this back home…</Text>
  <Text Key="5D98C8A2">Juvenile or not, {0.SimFirstName} knows it’s best not to cross a frightened alien. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} almost back to the Flea Market when the creature shows itself. It is a juvenile, whose big brother dared it to board {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy before arriving home. It will take off {0.SimFirstName}’s handcuffs if {M0.he}{F0.she} agrees....</Text>
  <Text Key="40D0E8F9">{0.SimFirstName} pulls the toilet over to a sunnier part of the rest stop. Now the aliens have everything they could ever need. "Our deity is so generous," cry the aliens. But now they're a little spoiled, and they start asking {0.SimFirstName} to smite their enemies.</Text>
  <Text Key="195B04C2">{M0.He}{F0.She} dismantles every non-essential part of the ship for extra sheet metal to cover the breach, but {0.SimFirstName} has seen better patches on pants. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} not even positive it will make re-entry into atmosphere! {M0.He}{F0.She} straps in for a bumpy landing.</Text>
  <Text Key="80E36573">{0.SimFirstName} gives them more food, more sunlight, and even starts giving some of the aliens rides from one end of the colony to another. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} basically become their slave, all just to get them to like {M0.him}{F0.her}. While they're sleeping, {0.SimFirstName} sneaks away to go home and meditate on the nature of co-dependency.</Text>
  <Text Key="C2534B3F">{0.SimFirstName} can't let the government see {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo, because then THEY'LL KNOW. But after jettisoning all the cargo, the ship is still too heavy! The only thing left is fuel and food, so {0.SimFirstName} starts eating all the astronaut food {M0.he}{F0.she} can.</Text>
  <Text Key="EDBAF3F8">Someone picks up {0.SimFirstName}’s distress call and claims to be nearby. In minutes, a large, rundown-looking fighter emerges from the nebula’s glow. “Follow us, {M0.Bucko}{F0.Buttercup}!” a low, reptilian voice says over the comm. Does {0.SimFirstName} follow?</Text>
  <Text Key="A7FEEB47">{0.SimFirstName} gently and lovingly sprinkles water on the crop fields. The plants start growing strong and the aliens rejoice! Now they want more sunshine.</Text>
  <Text Key="F8FDC9C3">{M0.He}{F0.She} unseals the air tank and peeks inside - there's nothing in it! Nothing at all! Suspicious! {M0.He}{F0.She} puts it in the air lock and jets it into space. A few minutes later {M0.he}{F0.she} sees an empty air tank float by {M0.his}{F0.her} window. How did that get there? Is someone following {F0.her}{M0.him}? Is that rogue tank a listening device?</Text>
  <Text Key="CFDF6553">Really? Are you sure you--I mean, {0.SimFirstName} should erase all the data on yo--{M0.HIS}{F0.HER} computer? All data will be permanently deleted. Proceed?</Text>
  <Text Key="9F895FEA">Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} gives a vicious war cry, and a high-speed dogfight follows! {0.SimFirstName} emerges the fearless victor. Avoiding the time-edge this time around, {F0.she}{M0.he} can return home safely.</Text>
  <Text Key="6CD36347">Why not? That should get the government off {0.SimFirstName}'s back! Maybe this hot plate will do the trick? No...no, that just causes pain. Lots and lots of pain. What can {M0.he}{F0.she} do to deal with it?</Text>
  <Text Key="7097221C">Hey! Turns out government-sanctioned bullying can be rather fun! Hovering over the yellow moon, {0.SimFirstName} blasts the volume on {M0.his}{F0.her} comm and demands to talk to the Rebel leader. A balding man in flowing robes emerges from a small hut and gazes up at {0.SimFirstName} fearfully.</Text>
  <Text Key="67583C2B">{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the seemingly undamaged station, but hears some odd laughter echoing down the halls. {M0.He}{F0.She} follows the strange sounds to the mess hall, where some clearly deranged astronauts are throwing bricks of freeze-dried ice cream at each other. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?</Text>
  <Text Key="488B2967">Correct! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} zooms through the cosmos, arriving at a debris field. What should {F0.she}{M0.he} do?!</Text>
  <Text Key="E84CCA95">While passing the asteroid belt, {0.SimFirstName} notices something ducking behind a nearby rock. {0.SimFirstName} slowly guides {M0.his}{F0.her} ship in to investigate.</Text>
  <Text Key="9EE16263">{0.SimFirstName} puts a paltry few boxes in the back of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. One box is smoking, and another's making a whimpering sound, but {0.SimFirstName} doesn't ask questions. {M0.He}{F0.She} delivers it on time and makes a few extra bucks.</Text>
  <Text Key="448F8693">With {0.SimFirstName}’s help, the colonists quickly access Hiattooine’s food replicators. Not only are they making non-grilled cheese, but they’re making them 1,000 times faster than before! Buried under an avalanche of inedible sandwiches, the government surrenders, agreeing to reopen talks if the colonists undo their handiwork. A victorious {0.SimFirstName} flies home, reward in hand.</Text>
  <Text Key="234F5E6D">Even in space, nature calls. {0.SimFirstName} docks with a starside rest station. It's pretty nasty in there…but then {0.SimFirstName} looks closely at the top of the toilet and discovers that it's inhabited by a teensy tiny alien civilization!</Text>
  <Text Key="2A9879A9">The results show that this ship once belonged to the Boronians, creatures of pure Boron. This is useful scientific data, as very little is known of creatures of the fifth element. Scans continue now that the results have been seen, and the rocket backs out of the wreck. What happened just before?</Text>
  <Text Key="9C041F27">Avoid the (Hypothetical) Booby Traps</Text>
  <Text Key="BD1F5C93">{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's robotronic arms to drag the escape pod on board through the airlock. After a few minutes of banging on the hatch, it pops open - and an alien creature pops out! {0.SimFirstName}'s not sure whether {M0.he}{F0.she} should try to catch it and subdue it, or just shove it out into space.</Text>
  <Text Key="5BC7FF87">{0.SimFirstName}'s generosity has allowed the aliens to grow complacent and spoiled. {M0.He}{F0.She} really didn't want this responsibility in the first place, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to get out while {M0.he}{F0.she} still can. As {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves, {M0.he}{F0.she} hears the panicked cries of the aliens, calling out for food, clothing, and medicine. {0.SimFirstName} hopes they'll be okay...</Text>
  <Text Key="D4792A92">Without light, the aliens can't grow anything or do anything…but neither can {0.SimFirstName}. Sitting in a public restroom in the dark isn't exactly thrilling, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to head for home, having learned exactly nothing about the effects of absolute power.</Text>
  <Text Key="9E624AFA">Being the supreme deity for an entire civilization seems like a lot of work, and {0.SimFirstName} doesn't think {M0.he's}{F0.she's} up for it. Let someone else deal with the responsibility. {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship and heads for home.</Text>
  <Text Key="988E7B07">{0.SimFirstName} is tired. So tired in fact, {M0.he}{F0.she} could fall asleep right here on the 69th floor, if weren't for all the howling. The animals in here are nothing like “Fitzy-Poo.” Finding a stairwell, {M0.he}{F0.she} heads back to the front desk. The alien is gone, but what's that {0.SimFirstName} hears? Whimpering from under the desk...?</Text>
  <Text Key="A08EC8E6">{0.SimFirstName} parks {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship and goes into the pound. The alien at the front desk raises an eye as {M0.he}{F0.she} walks in. “Job's filled,” she says. {0.SimFirstName} can explain about the missing dog… or make an excuse to look around.</Text>
  <Text Key="ACD5E5D0">{0.SimFirstName} wanders through the cloud. The dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic—an exquisite dream, or luxurious grave. {M0.He}{F0.She} is at peace with the beauty of {M0.his}{F0.her} lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into clear sky. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} free! All {M0.he}{F0.she} needs is a little more luck: {M0.he's}{F0.she's} got to get home on fumes.</Text>
  <Text Key="0FD41E31">Phew! {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship lands without a scratch and so far, no aliens are running out to greet {M0.him}{F0.her}. {0.SimFirstName} wanders into a half-collapsed temple, which seems to have been constructed of massive, porous rock. More strange space rocks are scattered about, along with a beautiful sacrificial bowl and other religious artifacts. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} bring an artifact home for analysis?</Text>
  <Text Key="7D27F208">{0.SimFirstName} finally connects with Tech Support. A pre-recorded voice says, "Hello. What can I help you with? You can say, 'ship repairs' or 'space madness.'"</Text>
  <Text Key="0C94D6A1">{0.SimFirstName} knows better. Battling the black hole’s pull, {M0.he}{F0.she} guides {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket alongside the alien’s and persuades him to abandon ship. The pilot is barely clear when his ship is sucked into oblivion, but he doesn't look too grateful. Giving {0.SimFirstName} a (very) little something for the help, he asks to be dropped at the next planet.</Text>
  <Text Key="148B5842">{0.SimFirstName} is on {M0.his}{F0.her} way home to deliver the prized pooch and collect {M0.his}{F0.her} reward! The animal under the desk had been Fitz all right, dyed brown in a lame attempt at disguise. But wait—there’s a fighter closing in. Then {0.SimFirstName} realizes: the injection was a tracker. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} can outmaneuver them.</Text>
  <Text Key="44DD42E8">{0.SimFirstName} thinks {F0.she}{M0.he} has done enough. The satellite probably sends out a better signal. Instead of a million Sims without coverage, it’s only hundreds of thousands. That’s a win on some level, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="201C4E82">The creature offers {0.SimFirstName} a special treasure for passing the trials. Then, {0.SimFirstName} watches in amazement as the creature points to the rocket, which seems to lift out of the swamp as if guided by an invisible force! Now {0.SimFirstName} can finally fly home and leave this weird planet far behind {M0.him}{F0.her}!</Text>
  <Text Key="105D73F0">{0.SimFirstName} wanders through the cloud. The dance of gold and purple is almost hypnotic—an exquisite dream, or luxurious grave. {M0.He}{F0.She} is at peace with the beauty of {M0.his}{F0.her} lugubrious fate when suddenly the ship breaks through into clear sky. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} free! And there before {M0.him}{F0.her} is a strange golden planet.</Text>
  <Text Key="97E02190">After wrestling with the strange and slippery creature, {0.SimFirstName} manages to wrangle it into a big specimen jar. {M0.He'll}{F0.She'll} take it back to Earth with {M0.him}{F0.her} for scientists to dissect. Err, "study."</Text>
  <Text Key="B3F2C278">The fighter leads {0.SimFirstName} out of the nebula, but then loops around to get a missile lock on {M0.his}{F0.her} ship! Quickly, {0.SimFirstName} shifts into hyperwarp and escapes. That's when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that the ship automatically picked up some mysterious cargo in the nebula. What could it be?</Text>
  <Text Key="AC01821F">{0.SimFirstName} sends a message of peace to the creature, who responds by flashing brightly green. It leads {0.SimFirstName} around to a hole in the asteroid, which {F0.she}{M0.he} can see is glowing with beautiful gems. {0.SimFirstName} grabs a few and stores them on {F0.her}{M0.his} ship.</Text>
  <Text Key="38ED2719">The camp is very busy, and it IS a matter of life or death. {0.SimFirstName} waits for the right chance, then slides the needed part off of a junk pile while the little creature is distracted. Before the theft can be discovered, {M0.he}{F0.she} runs off in the direction of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Time to make repairs and get home quickly!</Text>
  <Text Key="DCD42F5B">Nice try, spacesuit! {0.SimFirstName}'s pretty sure {M0.he'll}{F0.she'll} be fine without it! Spacesuits are a conspiracy by the fiberglass industry anyway. {M0.He}{F0.She} puts on a nice knitted hat and applies some sunscreen, then heads for the airlock door. But it's locked.</Text>
  <Text Key="D39E32A3">Passing the planet Yaaaaaaang, {0.SimFirstName} sees a weary-looking alien standing amid a huge pile of trash bags and rusty futon parts. Turns out he's moving to a new pad on the planet Rompiter, and his friend who was supposed to help just bailed! {0.SimFirstName}'s got some extra time - should {M0.he}{F0.she} pitch in?</Text>
  <Text Key="79DDF7C1">Bleep! Bleep! {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship has detected an unexpected object on the horizon. As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} can't believe {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes. Green, billowy treetops. Crystal blue streams. Could it be? The mystical Lush Planet! {0.SimFirstName} switches off {M0.his}{F0.her} turbo boosters as {M0.he}{F0.she} breaks through the planet’s atmosphere.</Text>
  <Text Key="765DCC09">Cruising slowly now, {0.SimFirstName} glides over miles and miles of thick jungle. At last! A clearing. But the clearing seems to be cluttered with alien ruins. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} land there anyway, where there’s less chance of crashing, or opt for the dense, dark cover of the jungle?</Text>
  <Text Key="7B50D5F0">{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's robotronic arms to take apart the escape pod. An extra voltrofibrilator and a spare dehexythermomatic gauge will really come in handy someday!</Text>
  <Text Key="771C68D9">Trying not to panic, {0.SimFirstName} scans the horizon for familiar stars. There! A flashing light. {M0.He}{F0.She} zooms closer only to discover a mysterious glass canister with what looks like a message beacon inside. Extracting it, {0.SimFirstName} finds a map with an X marked on a planet near the constellation’s head. It’s almost too good to be trusted… What now?</Text>
  <Text Key="95623F73">The probe is traversing the lunar landscape with agility and style! From {M0.his}{F0.her} tiny porthole, {0.SimFirstName} can see the droid having more fun than {F0.she}{M0.he}'s had in years. Luckily, it should at least bring back a souvenir.</Text>
  <Text Key="E5458987">{0.SimFirstName} asks the child what planet they're on, but before the child can answer, an army of spider-like aliens appears behind it. Dodging laser fire, {0.SimFirstName} leaps into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship and blasts off. {M0.He}{F0.She} sustains a few hits to {M0.his}{F0.her} landing system, but escapes. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the GPS working again in time to steer home.</Text>
  <Text Key="D478FB6A">The voice returns. "Your call is important to us. Would we play this music to you if you were not important to us?" The infuriating music seems to get louder. It has been 0.00003% of one galactic cycle.</Text>
  <Text Key="1E0D23C2">What’s the use of thrusters if you never get to use them? {0.SimFirstName} blasts {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters and rockets ahead, leaving Dog Girl, Red Tooth and everyone else in the dust. Nice win! Prize money in hand, {M0.he}{F0.she} hightails it out of there—not that any disgruntled losers could catch {M0.him}{F0.her}.</Text>
  <Text Key="FBDD56FF">After crossing over via the other ship's airlock, {0.SimFirstName} looks around and realizes that this must have been a science vessel - machines, sparkly rocks, plants, microscopes…yup, definitely science-y stuff. Where should {M0.he}{F0.she} explore next?</Text>
  <Text Key="3C05EEC2">{0.SimFirstName} should have known that the alien "statue" was too good a bargain. The creature isn’t dead—it’s just a stupid juvenile that was dared by its big brother to pretend. Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy and a free lift home. {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} could get charged with alien-napping, but it’s hard to refuse 4 pleading eyes…</Text>
  <Text Key="3412EFD4">{0.SimFirstName} decides to skip the propaganda and get the story from the colonists first. The instant {M0.he}{F0.she} lands on the yellow moon, {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship is surrounded by a mob of angry-looking colonists. Claiming that the planet government is oppressive, they plan on sabotaging the planet’s food replicators to make only non-grilled cheese. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?</Text>
  <Text Key="937CB1CE">{0.SimFirstName} opens throttle around the final bend, dusting Red Tooth and Dog Girl. This is it: time to show the galaxy what {M0.he}{F0.she} is made of. But then over the roar of {M0.his}{F0.her} engines comes a high-pitched whiz as Dog Girl blasts into hyperspeed. Is that legal?! Dog Girl takes first—this time.</Text>
  <Text Key="F046A8E6">Grasping the pipe tighter, {0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door and swings wildly. Something small and orange scampers behind a crate. Scanning the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees that a display for a taxidermied alien {M0.he}{F0.she} found is empty! “Don’t hurt me!” a tiny voice cries. Four eyes peek from behind the crate. {0.SimFirstName} lowers the pipe.</Text>
  <Text Key="72107817">On {M0.his}{F0.her} way over to the planet, {0.SimFirstName} gets more details from Dispatch. It seems that a colony on Planet Hiattooine’s moon is threatening to revolt and start their own government. Negotiations have broken down, and since neither side will talk to the other, it’s up to {0.SimFirstName} to mend the rift. Who will {M0.he}{F0.she} talk to first?</Text>
  <Text Key="3DAA3756">The lab is full of geodes and oozing, shimmering specimens. This is some serious science right here. {0.SimFirstName} starts going through the specimen jars when {M0.he}{F0.she} feels a rumbling from the belly of the ship. What was that?!</Text>
  <Text Key="F3EB8620">No two space duels begin the same way, but this alien seems to have a plan. With a wave of his tentacles, he zips off toward the horizon, then turns his starfighter to face {0.SimFirstName}’s. {0.SimFirstName} does the same, pauses, then veers back to charge the alien ship. This duel is on!</Text>
  <Text Key="745ECAE4">Deep in the Evil Cave, {0.SimFirstName} encounters {M0.his}{F0.her} ultimate challenge: Nega-{0.SimFirstName}!! It is the opposite of everything {0.SimFirstName} stands for! Luckily {0.SimFirstName} brought that weapon, so {M0.he}{F0.she} quickly dispatches it and heads for the surface. Now the creature can help you get home!</Text>
  <Text Key="4A3FC738">{0.SimFirstName} squeezes in behind the controls and pilots the little craft down the mountain. And by “pilots,” I mean “rolls.” And by “mountain,” I mean “insanely sharp rocks.” The good news is that a component not unlike a catalyzer lies in the wreckage. The bad news is that {0.SimFirstName} is now clutching a pretty bad gash in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. Night is falling.</Text>
  <Text Key="126D5F4E">Eureka! The hat goes on the head! More cheers spew forth from the crowd as {0.SimFirstName} rifles the hat into the stands with a flourish, to be caught by one lucky fan. The hatless pedestal sinks and disappears into the ground, and is shortly replaced again. This latest test pedestal appears to hold a chair: a simple, metal chair.</Text>
  <Text Key="BCCF6681">{0.SimFirstName} approaches one of the more clear-headed looking crew members and asks what's going on. It turns out that the entire crew has contracted some sort of space-induced madness! {0.SimFirstName} sneaks back to the rocket to contact command. Someone will be up shortly to help the crew.</Text>
  <Text Key="7B5A8C7A">With determination, {0.SimFirstName} stabs a finger down onto the button that jettisons all of the trash out of the rocket. Wait, what was {M0.he}{F0.she} supposed to be doing? Oh no!! The government can follow that trail of garbage RIGHT TO {M0.HIM}{F0.HER}!!</Text>
  <Text Key="DE2C973A">{0.SimFirstName} blasts off—and just in time, too! An army of spider-like aliens has covered the hillside and fires at {M0.his}{F0.her} retreating ship. Safely in space, {0.SimFirstName} goes to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot…Bingo! {0.SimFirstName}—and the treasure—are on their way home.</Text>
  <Text Key="FF5A3B6E">{0.SimFirstName} apologizes for not having the skills to fix the station and sends a message from the rocket to headquarters. It'll be a few days before help arrives, but the astronauts should make it, assuming no one hogs all the blankets.</Text>
  <Text Key="378247AB">{0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} surprise advantage to land the first hit, but it goes downhill from there. Note to self: never duel an alien with 14 more hands than you! The extra-handed extraterrestrial unleashes a wall of missile fire, and judging by the smoke and warning lights, {0.SimFirstName}’s ship has been hit! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} retreat, or fight to regain {M0.his}{F0.her} edge?</Text>
  <Text Key="82A985BB">The tank is no match for the powerful laser on {0.SimFirstName}'s rocket. ZZZZZT! It incinerates in a cloud of metal dust. Looks like {M0.he's}{F0.she's} outsmarted the government agents on {M0.his}{F0.her} trail. What's {0.SimFirstName}'s next move in this high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse?</Text>
  <Text Key="D3FC84AC">{0.SimFirstName} maneuvers the ship into the path of the space rock. With some clever flying, {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to deflect the asteroid off the ship's plating, causing it to fly harmlessly back into space. That was close!</Text>
  <Text Key="B1B91C3B">Turns out it IS that kind of race! {0.SimFirstName} gets a lock on Red Tooth and fires {M0.his}{F0.her} ion cannons, sending Red Tooth’s TS-555 hurtling off the track. {0.SimFirstName} easily closes the distance between {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and Dog Girl, blasting past her for the win and the top prize!</Text>
  <Text Key="740909D4">Correct! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} zooms through the cosmos, and approaches an unknown vessel. Communications open; what should {M0.he}{F0.she} say?!</Text>
  <Text Key="60634BB3">{0.SimFirstName} waits for the alien to search her computer for record of Fitz, the pookapoo. Apparently nothing comes up. The alien hands back the photo and claims to have dogs to feed. But she doesn’t get up. {0.SimFirstName} notices a small red leash—much like in Fitz’s photo—sticking out of a box under the desk. What now?</Text>
  <Text Key="BEEDF0D6">{0.SimFirstName} sees some unsavory characters approaching fast in {M0.his}{F0.her} rearview mirror...uh oh! Those are space pirates, and {0.SimFirstName}'s about to be shipjacked. They demand a suitcase full of Simoleons to let {0.SimFirstName} pass...OR ELSE.</Text>
  <Text Key="10CDDDA1">{0.SimFirstName} pilots {M0.his}{F0.her} ship to a remote rest-stop, but just as {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} about to pry open the first crate, {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a small red flashing light. A tracker! Just then the alien knocks at {M0.his}{F0.her} window. As the smuggler unloads his stuff, he slips {0.SimFirstName} a small package in thanks before vanishing in a cloud of exhaust.</Text>
  <Text Key="624CFA0E">Without water for their crops, the tiny, helpless aliens start to wither away. In order to appease their deity, they start sacrificing some of their pets and livestock at a tiny temple, where they've drawn a crude picture of {0.SimFirstName}'s face.</Text>
  <Text Key="D44B9574">Well, this is going...not great. {0.SimFirstName}'s ship crashes spectacularly into the surface of the planet. According to the damage diagnostic, the ship won't be safe to fly until {0.SimFirstName} can replace the catalyzer on the port compression coil. It's a nothing part--until you don't have one. {0.SimFirstName} steps out of {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and begins the search.</Text>
  <Text Key="8C0596BF">No one answers {0.SimFirstName}’s distress call. This massive ball of dust and gas must be absorbing all comm signals. There’s nothing to do but forge forward and hope {M0.he}{F0.she} can get free before {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel’s gone!</Text>
  <Text Key="5F306B31">So much better… Free of handcuffs, {0.SimFirstName} sizes up the creature {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} bought as taxidermy—it’s just a stupid juvenile that was dared by its brother to pretend! Now it wants a joy ride around the galaxy and a free lift home. {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} could get charged with alien-napping, but {M0.he}{F0.she} did promise…</Text>
  <Text Key="D653E832">{0.SimFirstName} suits up, opens the doors, and floats toward the satellite. As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets closer, {0.SimFirstName} notices that there are...sprinkles in the goop? What?! {0.SimFirstName} pulls out {M0.his}{F0.her} space shammy and wipes some off. {M0.He}{F0.She} sniffs it and then takes a taste. It's frosting! {0.SimFirstName} takes a sample for lab analysis (and for a snack) then returns to the ship.</Text>
  <Text Key="895CA3B2">The old trader's ship is overflowing with cargo--he offers to let {0.SimFirstName} keep some of the cargo if {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll transport the rest to his buyer on Earth. {0.SimFirstName}'s ship's cargo bay isn't very large, and the extra weight could crash {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} risk it, or just take a little bit of the goods?</Text>
  <Text Key="45E49704">{0.SimFirstName} stares down at a formidable tower on a red planet. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound isn’t just a fable. It’s real! {0.SimFirstName} is searching for Mrs. Foozzin’s prized pookapoo—a rare breed of space dog that could bring big bucks on the black market. It will bring big bucks to {0.SimFirstName}, too, if {M0.he}{F0.she} brings it home unscathed.</Text>
  <Text Key="619CDF47">Oh, all-powerful {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} truly must have a master plan, chant the grateful aliens. They're so happy that {M0.he's}{F0.she's} chosen to help them rebuild their society. Maybe being benevolent is the better way to rule?</Text>
  <Text Key="571E7E26">After a long walk, {0.SimFirstName} finally sees signs of life. {M0.He}{F0.She} appears to have discovered a large camp, filled with little creatures bustling about and trading small bits of junk they’ve scavenged from various crash sites. One little merchant near {M0.him}{F0.her} has a part that would be a suitable replacement for the catalyzer. But how to obtain it...?</Text>
  <Text Key="C29AB831">When {0.SimFirstName} clicks the "Update" button to update the dynotherm drivers, a helpful message appears saying the request cannot be completed because the dynotherm drivers have not been updated.</Text>
  <Text Key="E8771463">Since {0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.his}{F0.her} way around a machine, it doesn’t take long to figure out the alien components. There’s a part not unlike a catalyzer that should do the trick, and it looks like {M0.he}{F0.she} can still get back to the ship before night falls. Time to head home.</Text>
  <Text Key="7B7239A4">This is not going well at all. Dog Girl has taken the lead, but instead of chasing her, Red Tooth seems intent on menacing {0.SimFirstName}, maneuvering to block {M0.him}{F0.her} at every turn. Could they be working together? Regardless, {0.SimFirstName} is tired of looking up Red Tooth’s tail-lights. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to blast him out of the way or play fair?</Text>
  <Text Key="0D1C32E1">Praise to {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.He}{F0.She} drags a table near the toilet so the alien colony can expand. Now that the aliens have all the land they need to build and grow, they seem to be doing okay. {0.SimFirstName} leaves on a high note.</Text>
  <Text Key="9FB75474">These mountains would break most Sims, but thanks to {0.SimFirstName}’s good physical condition, {M0.he}{F0.she} eventually makes {M0.his}{F0.her} way to the summit. The curl of smoke {M0.he}{F0.she} spotted earlier is pouring from an alien ship! {0.SimFirstName} might be able to pilot it out of here, or {M0.he}{F0.she} could try scavenging a suitable part for {M0.his}{F0.her} own ship.</Text>
  <Text Key="F23FAEA9">*Bzzt* {0.SimFirstName}! Come in!*bzzt* 
Commander Vanderwander needs {M0.his}{F0.her} help! There is a satellite out in orbit that is malfunctioning. Millions of Sims are complaining about their poor cell phone data coverage! They want to post pics of their food, their kittens, and their profound fortune cookies but can’t! The commander needs {0.SimFirstName} to take a look!</Text>
  <Text Key="898CF08F">The debris reassembles into a fierce pirate ship, while laserblasts spawn and retract into their respective blasters! An epic battle un-ensues, and the ships drift further apart. Communications become active; what did {0.SimFirstName} say to the pirate captain?!</Text>
  <Text Key="92771F9A">After wandering for a very long time, {0.SimFirstName} discovers a wrecked ship similar in structure to {M0.his}{F0.hers}! There’s even a part that could possibly replace the catalyzer! Unfortunately, when {0.SimFirstName} pulls it free, the wreckage shifts and a piece of jagged metal leaves a deep cut in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. Better get back to the ship quickly…</Text>
  <Text Key="799B1418">{0.SimFirstName} sees a large ship floating silently ahead - it looks abandoned, or at least very poorly maintained. Should {0.SimFirstName} try to board it to see what's inside, or just use the robotronic arm to collect some spare parts from the outside?</Text>
  <Text Key="172C2CA6">Whoa, that escalated quickly. But {0.SimFirstName}'s quick offensive strike took the pirates by surprise, and they crumble into a teary, blubbering puddle. They even offer {0.SimFirstName} some spare wires and loose change to entice {M0.him}{F0.her} to leave them alone.</Text>
  <Text Key="EFC77785">Promising to infiltrate the government’s food replicators, {0.SimFirstName} blasts off for the planet. As soon as {M0.he}{F0.she} lands, a government official waves {M0.him}{F0.her} in to see the Emperor, Yang Holmby. Warning him of the Rebel plot, {0.SimFirstName} quashes the revolution—and receives a handsome reward for {M0.his}{F0.her} help.</Text>
  <Text Key="12E1242E">It’s a tight squeeze, but {0.SimFirstName}'s rocketship lands without a scratch. Instantly it’s surrounded by blue furry creatures! They’re small—about the size of a common house cat—but {0.SimFirstName} has never seen anything quite as toothy, and there are hundreds of them. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to capture one alive, or euthanize one and bring it back for analysis?</Text>
  <Text Key="705C8190">That would explain it. As {0.SimFirstName} gets closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees that an alien spaceship is being pulled towards a massive black hole! {0.SimFirstName} offers to transport the owner of the ship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, but the alien begs {M0.him}{F0.her} to save the whole ship. “I’ll reward you! Pleeeeease!” Should {M0.he}{F0.she} risk it?</Text>
  <Text Key="B2034E9C">The aliens will never again want for water! {0.SimFirstName} is so benevolent! The aliens sing {M0.his}{F0.her} praises. Now they're praying to {M0.him}{F0.her} for more land for their fields and livestock.</Text>
  <Text Key="D4132BC1">{0.SimFirstName} carefully guides the rocket into orbit over a small alien world, but it’s clear right away that something is wrong. Ionic interference in the planet’s thermosphere is causing havoc with the ship’s primary systems. {0.SimFirstName} decides to attempt an emergency landing, which is smart since {M0.he}{F0.she} has no other choice…</Text>
  <Text Key="57896F5F">The grizzled old trader has an offer for {0.SimFirstName} - deliver some of his cargo back to Earth, and {0.SimFirstName} can keep some of it! {M0.He}{F0.She} can use it {F0.her}{M0.him}self or make big bucks selling it. The cargo bay is pretty large, so {0.SimFirstName} accepts the offer.</Text>
  <Text Key="172120DB">{0.SimFirstName} slides into place at the starting line. To {M0.his}{F0.her} right, a souped up XR315 piloted by a female canine-sapien. To {M0.his}{F0.her} left, a brawny alien revving the engine of his TS-555, his sneer revealing a row of sparkling red teeth. Bang! The starting gun fires and they’re off!</Text>
  <Text Key="8D8017DF">"Ship repairs," {0.SimFirstName} carefully enunciates into the comm. "You have selected: Self Destruct," the voice says, "Remotely engaging your ship's self destruct function now."</Text>
  <Text Key="EA3F5B64">{0.SimFirstName} doesn't remember much, but thinks {F0.she}{M0.he} may have been abducted! {M0.He}{F0.She} now stands in a small, sterile arena. A motley assemblage of hideous beings sits, furtively, in the bleachers. Slowly, a pedestal rises from the floor; it contains two items: a ball, and a container with two holes, one round and one triangular. The room is tense with excitement.</Text>
  <Text Key="07A441C4">{0.SimFirstName} slowly opens the door and peers inside. Just then, something soft and squishy thumps onto {M0.his}{F0.her} back and a tentacle threads around {M0.his}{F0.her} neck. “Don’t move!” a small voice whispers. Everything goes black. {0.SimFirstName} faints, which is technically moving.</Text>
  <Text Key="4F97237C">Hmm, {0.SimFirstName} really doesn't have a big enough cargo bay. The alien's got a lot of incense burners and bottle koozies, and they might not all fit in the ship. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} try to just cram it in there, or give up?</Text>
  <Text Key="7BC81319">After dismantling {M0.his}{F0.her} bunk for extra sheet metal, {0.SimFirstName} patches the hole! The inside pressure stabilizes and it looks like the ship will make it back to Earth! Some of the debris could be valuable... at the very least, {0.SimFirstName} can Internet-shame the litterbug who got {M0.him}{F0.her} into this mess. {M0.He}{F0.She} collects a scoopful and sets course for home.</Text>
  <Text Key="FEE64C7D">{0.SimFirstName}'s leg is starting to cramp.  {M0.He}{F0.She} is crouched in the Cosmic Relief stairwell, and {M0.he's}{F0.she's} been watching the front desk for what feels like forever. Finally, the alien stands, scratches, checks something under the desk and seems to say something before waddling off. Gotcha! It's now or never.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F3EFDB5">{0.SimFirstName} shines {M0.his}{F0.her} flashlight on the cropland, and the plants grow taller than ever! The aliens are so happy that they invent painting, music, and philosophy. With civilization progressing so well, {0.SimFirstName} figures that {M0.his}{F0.her} work is done. {M0.He}{F0.She} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship and heads home.</Text>
  <Text Key="5F81E678">The fresh air really helped, and now {M0.he}{F0.she} feels better. If {0.SimFirstName} actually had Space Madness {M0.he}{F0.she}'d start getting paranoid and making really terrible decisions. Now...how to spend the day up here in space?</Text>
  <Text Key="D6FDBA3C">Ugh, {0.SimFirstName} feels even worse now. This isn't good--it definitely sounds like Space Madness. The next symptom is making really bad decisions. If {M0.he}{F0.she} just concentrates {M0.he}{F0.she} should be okay. Now...how to fix the air flow?</Text>
  <Text Key="24915BC3">Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} scans the wreck, gaining invaluable scientific knowledge. Avoiding the time-edge, {F0.she}{M0.he} safely makes {M0.his}{F0.her} way home.</Text>
  <Text Key="F51F6EAF">This creature is surprisingly slippery, even by slimy alien standards! {0.SimFirstName} just can't keep ahold of it and it gets away and starts chewing through some electrical cables. Hmm… hope {0.SimFirstName} wasn't going to need those cables for the journey home....</Text>
  <Text Key="2D8E35C9">{0.SimFirstName} finally returns to the ship, exhausted. The alien part had made a pretty good club, stunning the giant beast with one solid whack. It gave {0.SimFirstName} just enough time to find a place to hide until the injured creature finally staggered away. Now to repair the ship, dress these wounds, and get back home!</Text>
  <Text Key="350DBA74">{0.SimFirstName}'s instruments go haywire and {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship is bathed in purple light. Purple and gold dust coats the sky as far as the eye can see—which isn't that far. {M0.He}{F0.She} must have drifted into a giant nebula! {0.SimFirstName} can send out a call for help, or forge ahead and hope the instruments can sort it out.</Text>
  <Text Key="97EA24AB">{0.SimFirstName} sets to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot. Reboot. Yes! A signal at last. {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts off—and just in time, too. An army of spidery aliens has covered the hillside and opens fire. Pushing {M0.his}{F0.her} engines to the limit, {0.SimFirstName} gets free, but not without sustaining a few hits to {M0.his}{F0.her} thermal system. This’ll be a rocky landing…</Text>
  <Text Key="552F7D96">Thinking quickly, {0.SimFirstName} offers the child some treasure if it will tell {M0.him}{F0.her} which planet {M0.he}{F0.she} has landed on. Now {0.SimFirstName} can radio in {M0.his}{F0.her} location and get directions home! Rewarding the child, {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts off with the bulk of {M0.his}{F0.her} treasure still intact. Clever!</Text>
  <Text Key="2CB8BA65">{0.SimFirstName} did what was asked of {F0.her}{M0.him}. There’s no point risking {M0.his}{F0.her} life for cell phone data. As long as this satellite is left unharmed, then it was a success.</Text>
  <Text Key="7DDFA59F">Well, looks like even the pound has its processes. Having made up a story about losing {M0.his}{F0.her} mutt, {0.SimFirstName} fills out {M0.his}{F0.her} 13 forms while waiting for an escort to the cages. {M0.He}{F0.She} is handing them in when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a small red leash—much like in Fitz’s photo—sticking out of a box under the desk. What now?</Text>
  <Text Key="5A93478B">Ouch. {0.SimFirstName}’s head hurts, and when {M0.he}{F0.she} tries to move, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} handcuffed to {M0.his}{F0.her} pilot seat. A sharp, cold object is poking {M0.his}{F0.her} back. “T-t-take me home,” a voice stammers. It’s oddly deep—and {0.SimFirstName} realizes it’s a juvenile voice trying to sound older. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} comply or try to reason with the juvenile?</Text>
  <Text Key="22BD686D">Oh, why didn't {0.SimFirstName} spring for the extra-tacky coating on {M0.his}{F0.her} space gloves? Breathing heavily {M0.he}{F0.she} bounces down the body of the ship, desperate grabs failing to find purchase. Finally {M0.he}{F0.she} gets hold of some cables, ripping the hydraulic line for the ship's stabilizers. The ship automatically activates its emergency beacon.</Text>
  <Text Key="B494B3D4">It's just a person-sized hole in the hull. So it's not perfectly sealed. So it might let in stray meteors and space contaminants. So {0.SimFirstName}'s combustible little body might go up in flames as the ship re-enters the atmosphere. {M0.He}{F0.She} can make this landing, right? Right?</Text>
  <Text Key="177C5AEF">As the conversation plays back in reverse, though it sounds like gibberish, {0.SimFirstName} can detect where it all might have gone wrong. What happened just before this?</Text>
  <Text Key="507A3F07">{0.SimFirstName} returns from the jungle with a modest pile of berries. “Know these were poisonous, did you?” the creature asks before shoving several into his mouth. “Mah favrite,” he sputters through a mushy mouthful. The final trial is to explore the Evil Cave. He gives {0.SimFirstName} a weapon, then oddly stresses that {M0.he}{F0.she} will not need it.</Text>
  <Text Key="7A0B8AC1">With the stabilizers {0.SimFirstName} installed, {M0.he}{F0.she} is able to retain some control of the ship. It just barely misses a formation of sharp-looking rocks and lands roughly in a swamp a few miles beyond. Struggling onto dry land, {0.SimFirstName} wonders how {M0.he}{F0.she} is going to get the rocket out of the muck and back into space…</Text>
  <Text Key="F78A3FAC">It's Fitz! Before the aliens can stop {M0.him}{F0.her}, {0.SimFirstName} is out the door with the prized pooch and on the way to collect {M0.his}{F0.her} reward! A quick call to the Galactic Rangers on the way should take care of the pound's illegal animal trade.</Text>
  <Text Key="96AAD92E">So far, so good. Ever since {0.SimFirstName} braced the door, the cargo hold has been silent. If {M0.he}{F0.she} can make it to a pest extermination station, {M0.he}{F0.she} can get the problem taken care of and be on {M0.his}{F0.her} way. But then a new sound starts. Small. Sad. Sobbing? Does {0.SimFirstName} stick to {M0.his}{F0.her} guns, or peek in the hold?</Text>
  <Text Key="7E91F2D1">{0.SimFirstName} staggers toward {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, one hand dragging the catalyzer, the other gripping the wound in {M0.his}{F0.her} side. It’s not far now, but {0.SimName} suddenly hears a low growl. A very large creature has crept up behind {M0.him}{F0.her}. It’s a mad dash to the safety of the ship! Then again, the catalyzer has a good heft… could be used as a weapon.</Text>
  <Text Key="B7A018C6">{0.SimFirstName} calls out. No answer. The only sound is a soft dripping. Donning {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty headlamp, {M0.he}{F0.she} treads quietly into the tunnel, deeper and deeper until {M0.he}{F0.she} sees a beam of light coming through a crack in the ceiling. Under it is a locked box! Should {M0.he}{F0.she} pry it open here or bring it back to the ship?</Text>
  <Text Key="18BAC9A8">{0.SimFirstName} is still choking on the alien spacecraft’s exhaust when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears sirens blaring in the distance. The space police surround {0.SimFirstName}’s rocket ship and demand to search {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo bay. {M0.He}{F0.She} can turn over the goods and hope for the best, or help the alien—and possibly {M0.himself}{F0.herself}—by hiding it.</Text>
  <Text Key="98C30E94">Harsh words, insults, and finally, salutations are taken back as the conversation undoes itself. An interesting experience for sure. What happened just before this?</Text>
  <Text Key="780E3C4B">One by one {0.SimFirstName} starts ejecting the escape pods from {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, watching them drift off into space. But the ship is still too heavy! Why is it so heavy? Something else has to go. {0.SimFirstName} starts panicking, because if the ship is too heavy it will definitely crash!</Text>
  <Text Key="3ADD77A1">{0.SimFirstName} acts fast. Heaving the box onto {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulders, {M0.he}{F0.she} crams it into {M0.his}{F0.her} cargo hold, but can’t resist a peek before  working on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Treasure—mounds of it! Someone will be looking for this soon. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} can sense a rumbling in the distance which seems to be getting closer…</Text>
  <Text Key="427A5D46">Using some paper clips, half a box of aluminum foil, and a plunger, {0.SimFirstName} manages to cobble together a new power coupling. Upon installing it, the space station hums back to life. The crew is very grateful.</Text>
  <Text Key="F58F2CE6">Those pathetic pirates practically trip over each other in order to get out of {0.SimFirstName}'s way. But before they go, they wash {0.SimFirstName}'s windshield and give {M0.him}{F0.her} a quick oil change, just to stay on {M0.his}{F0.her} good side.</Text>
  <Text Key="8B39E5F0">It's been a while since {0.SimFirstName} had to hotwire anything. Wait...does {M0.he}{F0.she} know how to hotwire stuff or was that a guy on TV? Oh well, how hard can it be, right? Now is it red-wire-to-blue-wire, or red-wire-to-green-wire?</Text>
  <Text Key="D3FC34B9">{0.SimFirstName} sets to work on {M0.his}{F0.her} GPS. Reboot. Reboot. Reboot. Yes! There it is—a signal at last! {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts off—and just in time, too. An army of spidery aliens has covered the hillside and fires at {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Good thing {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got these trusty thrusters. {0.SimFirstName} is free, clear and on {M0.his}{F0.her} way home in no time!</Text>
  <Text Key="B7720F17">{0.SimFirstName} does {M0.his}{F0.her} best to scale the impossible terrain, but it proves too difficult. {M0.He}{F0.She} resolves to get more exercise when (if) {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back home. The western valley is the only way left to go now, but the light is starting to fade…</Text>
  <Text Key="69C59A99">{0.SimFirstName} wakes up in a groggy haze, covered with freeze-dried crumbs. {M0.He}{F0.She} notices the lights are so BRIGHT in here, and the color of the rocket walls is way too GREEN. This is unacceptable. It'll attract Xargons! How should {0.SimFirstName} avoid the Xargons?</Text>
  <Text Key="40378033">The round ball deftly slides into the round hole, and the room erupts into ferocious applause! {0.SimFirstName} instinctively bows graciously as the puzzle recedes back into the floor, replaced by a new one.  This next rising pedestal has… a hat?  Yes, it’s a very fine hat, perhaps a derby! What should {0.SimFirstName} do?</Text>
  <Text Key="BD3DEE7F">The guard injects {0.SimFirstName}'s arm with a long shiny needle, then leads {M0.him}{F0.her} into the pound, which consists of floor after floor of caged beasts—mostly large, growling earth mutts. “First 69 floors,” the guard says. {0.SimFirstName} can start looking for Fitz—or look for a way back to that leash at the front desk.</Text>
  <Text Key="D4D60DB2">Ah yes. Turn it off and then turn it back on. The preferred tech solution of professional rocket scientists everywhere. The dynotherms sputter and a new message appears: "Your dynotherms did not shut down properly. Would you like to restart your dynotherms in Safe Mode?"</Text>
  <Text Key="08382F2A">{0.SimFirstName} is just biting into {M0.his}{F0.her} astronaut ice cream sandwich when {M0.he}{F0.she} spots a small craft that seems to be hailing {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Is someone in trouble? {0.SimFirstName} blasts in for a closer look.</Text>
  <Text Key="55578C5D">Thanks to {0.SimFirstName}’s focus, {F0.her}{M0.his} aim was impeccable and all the goop was shot off!</Text>
  <Text Key="F1557D65">{0.SimFirstName}'s wrath is truly fearsome! The aliens are terrified of their capricious, angry deity. But it turns out that being an angry deity doesn't win you many friends. A few hardy rebels band together to try to drive {0.SimFirstName} away forever. How should {0.SimFirstName} deal with this uprising?</Text>
  <Text Key="1B953903">When {0.SimFirstName} wakes up, {M0.he}{F0.she} is lying on the asphalt next to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship with a sore arm. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound is locked, and the only response to {M0.his}{F0.her} knocks is barking. On {M0.his}{F0.her} way home, flashes of the incident return: a burly guard, a gleaming needle. Maybe {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} try again another time.</Text>
  <Text Key="94A08111">{0.SimFirstName} smashes the rebels (quite literally - {M0.he}{F0.she} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe). But with the strongest of the aliens destroyed, things don't look so good for their civilization. {0.SimFirstName} leaves before {M0.he}{F0.she} can be blamed for some kind of extinction event.</Text>
  <Text Key="0DA96BE4">{0.SimFirstName} and the trader load up the ship and {0.SimFirstName} blasts away. {M0.He}{F0.She} heads for home - it's smooth sailing, there's no traffic in the asteroid belt, and {M0.he's}{F0.she's} even getting pretty good gas mileage. Plus, {M0.he's}{F0.she's} on track for a sweet payday when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets home! </Text>
  <Text Key="F9777D0E">{0.SimFirstName} speaks in {M0.his}{F0.her} most comforting, non-threatening voice and explains to the pirates how very disappointed {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} be if they stranded {M0.him}{F0.her} in deep space. But these pirates didn't get where they are by being empathetic, so they tear the wiring out of {M0.his}{F0.her} vermenticular fusion box. Hmm...might be a little hard to land the ship without that.</Text>
  <Text Key="FEC15DC5">Disappointed, the alien offers {0.SimFirstName} some choice pieces of space junk if {M0.he}{F0.she} will come back and duel later. Knowing {M0.his}{F0.her} ship isn’t fully equipped to beat this hotshot, {0.SimFirstName} takes the junk and promises to return, once {M0.he}{F0.she} has traded it for some key upgrades. {M0.He}{F0.She} turns {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, relieved, toward home.</Text>
  <Text Key="F0874CC6">{0.SimFirstName} is too smart for them! That chair is on one of those moving platforms! As the crowd applauds {0.SimFirstName}’s wisdom and foresight, the chair sinks down into the dark recesses in the floor, replaced by the next challenge. This pedestal is made of solid gold, and contains valuable looking jewels!</Text>
  <Text Key="0B7B343D">{0.SimFirstName} takes aim with the standard cannons and attempts to shoot off the goop! It seemed to work a little bit as some of the pink substance floats off into space, but that could have been a disaster.</Text>
  <Text Key="758A7B12">{0.SimFirstName} fires {M0.his}{F0.her} ship's blasters at the creature, which immediately shatters into a bajillion pieces. {0.SimFirstName} gathers some of the pieces and leaves, quickly.</Text>
  <Text Key="5677D753">{0.SimFirstName} hails Tech Support on the comm. A recorded voice says, "Your call is important to us. We will be with you within one galactic cycle." A galactic cycle is a measurement of time equal to 394 Sim years. Infuriating music plays.</Text>
  <Text Key="1A1CEDB5">Yeehaw! Nothing like a wide-eyed kid to make {0.SimFirstName} feel like a hero. And with four eyes the effect is doubled! After a speedrace around Planet Toomootoo and a few stellar flips, {M0.he}{F0.she} deposits 4 Eyes at home and receives a nice reward from its mom.</Text>
  <Text Key="8343B5AA">Ugh, NOW the aliens are angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for ignoring them. Don't they understand that {0.SimFirstName}'s just not the murdering type? Being a deity really is a lose-lose proposition. {0.SimFirstName}'s so frustrated with their pettiness that {M0.he}{F0.she} just leaves. What a waste of time.</Text>
  <Text Key="673892F7">From the swamp, {0.SimFirstName} pulls some kind of fish. The creature smiles. “Typically given only during a mating ritual, this is,” he says, “but ignore that for now, I will.” The final trial is to explore the Evil Cave. The creature gives {0.SimFirstName} a weapon, then oddly stresses that {M0.he}{F0.she} will not need it.</Text>
  <Text Key="A0B0934A">Wooh! Free jewels! {0.SimFirstName} snatches the valuable rocks as the crowd gives a standing ovation to {M0.his}{F0.her} prudent sense of value. “The creature had passed the trials! May {M0.his}{F0.her} species flourish and grow!” {M0.he}{F0.she} hears, before being materialized safely back in {M0.his}{F0.her} ship, already nearing home.</Text>
  <Text Key="07AC6DA0">{0.SimFirstName} pulls up to the extermination station drive-thru and begins to explain the situation to the guys at the window. Unfortunately, the sobbing has gotten louder—MUCH louder. Unconvinced that {0.SimFirstName} has a sobbing rat on board, they refuse to help. Now what?</Text>
  <Text Key="522EC69A">When the aliens see {0.SimFirstName} looming over them, they immediately fall to their knees and start chanting - they obviously think {M0.he's}{F0.she's} some sort of supreme being come to rule them. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} stick around a while, or just be on {M0.his}{F0.her} way?</Text>
  <Text Key="8D890AFE">Touchdown! The beagle has landed! {0.SimFirstName} is now safely on the moon. Should {F0.she}{M0.he} send out the scientific-looking probe, or get out there and explore the surface for {F0.her}{M0.him}self?</Text>
  <Text Key="DFE767D1">Well, there were no listening devices that {0.SimFirstName} could find. Good. The government agents don't seem to have tracked {M0.him}{F0.her}...so far. But {0.SimFirstName} needs to be sure.</Text>
  <Text Key="EAC116D8">{0.SimFirstName}’s upgraded ship makes quick work of this arrogant extraterrestrial. Humbled by {0.SimFirstName}’s skill, the alien offers {M0.him}{F0.her} a reward beyond {M0.his}{F0.her} wildest imaginings! {0.SimFirstName} blasts home with {M0.his}{F0.her} prize before the alien can reconsider.</Text>
  <Text Key="E4C45B33">So much for a change of scene. {0.SimFirstName} has no sooner landed than a government official waves {M0.him}{F0.her} in to see Yang Holmby, the Emperor. It isn’t easy to understand him through all his spluttering, but he insists that {0.SimFirstName} menace the colonists into submission. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} agree?</Text>
  <Text Key="1D7A654B">That's one small step for Sim, one slightly awkward, lunging step for Sim-kind. {0.SimFirstName} explores the lunar seas, the lunar rocks, and the other lunar rocks. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes some for the trip home.</Text>
  <Text Key="95D045FF">{0.SimFirstName} recalls a nifty trick. Pursing {M0.his}{F0.her} lips, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets out a shrill alien mating cry. The egomaniac pilot turns 2 eyes on the horizon and 1 on his mirror, losing sight of {0.SimFirstName} just long enough. {0.SimFirstName} lands another hit, tying the score as the clock runs out. Impressed, the alien says they should fight again soon. {0.SimFirstName} heads proudly home.</Text>
  <Text Key="80A4E6E4">While cruising comfortably somewhere in the vicinity of the Vega Startron, {0.SimFirstName} sees a banged-up escape pod drifting out of orbit. Lights are flickering - maybe something's inside? If {M0.he}{F0.she} brings it on board {M0.his}{F0.her}  ship, {M0.he}{F0.she} can see what it is. Or {M0.he}{F0.she} could just use it for spare parts.</Text>
  <Text Key="5577BB2F">"See, when you say threatening things, it makes me feel very unsafe," says {0.SimFirstName}. Good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} watched all those episodes of Celeb Talk Therapy on TV - {M0.he}{F0.she} knows the lingo! The pirates have a breakthrough and leave to go apologize to their mothers. They even leave {0.SimFirstName} a few bucks for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble.</Text>
  <Text Key="6059517A">While tumbling head over heels, {0.SimFirstName} somehow manages to grab onto one of the ship's fins, and {M0.he}{F0.she} gradually pulls {M0.himself}{F0.herself} back into the ship. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s not floating  away into nothingness (which is good!), but {M0.his}{F0.her} ship still has a giant hole in the side (which is less good). What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?</Text>
  <Text Key="EA296959">Good thing {0.SimFirstName} has an expanded cargo bay. It's a lot of stuff to move (old concert tees, milk crate furniture, blacklight posters), but it all fits in pretty easily, and they blast off for Rompiter. The alien is so grateful, he gives {0.SimFirstName} his least-dirty futon mattress as thanks. {0.SimFirstName} incinerates it.</Text>
  <Text Key="D6E52D0F">Right! That’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} explores the debris and finds a treasure! Avoiding the time-edge, {F0.she}{M0.he} can safely return home!</Text>
  <Text Key="CE2F398E">In the distance, {0.SimFirstName} sees another ship blast its trash out the airlock - now all that space debris is hurtling {0.SimFirstName}’s way! A rusty waffle iron strikes {M0.his}{F0.her} craft and tears a hole in the fuselage. {0.SimFirstName} is sucked out into deep space! {M0.He}{F0.She} takes a moment to be thankful {M0.he}{F0.she} put on {M0.his}{F0.her} full space suit today. Now what?</Text>
  <Text Key="8FF770B9">{0.SimFirstName} is nearing the sun when {M0.he}{F0.she} spies an immense flying saucer with a jolly-looking alien wedged into the cockpit. The alien is manipulating some kind of phase beam to fire asteroids directly into the sun. As each asteroid hits, the sun flares and the alien laughs. What should {0.SimFirstName} do?</Text>
  <Text Key="7BFA2B3F">{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the satellite and notices it’s covered in a light pink goop! But why?! What… is … it?</Text>
  <Text Key="1E52A022">{0.SimFirstName} is suddenly feeling anxious and jumpy. There's a strange tingling sensation in {M0.his}{F0.her} hands and feet, and {M0.he}{F0.she} feels a little light-headed. Could {M0.he}{F0.she} have Space Madness?? Could be something wrong with the air flow...?</Text>
  <Text Key="3C0ECFFC">{0.SimFirstName} decides to attack a band of ruthless space pirates with {M0.his}{F0.her} ship. Immediately they point the hugest, most scary-looking space cannon {0.SimFirstName}'s ever seen directly at {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and press FIRE. An ion beam surges into the prow of the ship. It begins belching a thick purple smoke, and {0.SimFirstName} has to retreat for home.</Text>
  <Text Key="3E5835C2">{0.SimFirstName} pries open the box and is nearly blinded by the glowing treasure inside! Better get it back quick. {0.SimFirstName} is trying to heave the heavy box onto {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulders when {M0.he}{F0.she} senses someone watching {M0.him}{F0.her}. Looking up, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees not two eyes, but hundreds. {0.SimFirstName} can try to explain {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of this, or run like crazy.</Text>
  <Text Key="FFDBFC7F">{0.SimFirstName} notices an odd, green-colored creature shaped like a plumbob. It doesn't seem to have realized that {0.SimFirstName} was nearby. Should {0.SimFirstName} try to communicate with it or watch quietly from a distance?</Text>
  <Text Key="005E9805">{0.SimFirstName} arrives at the station which is unusually dark. {M0.He}{F0.She} flips on a flashlight and is startled by a disheveled-looking astronaut. "Thank goodness you came! Our main power coupling is shot. Is there anything you can do to help?"</Text>
  <Text Key="489B7C27">{0.SimFirstName} has never been violently ousted, but it doesn't sound like much fun, even when the subjects are nearly microscopic. {M0.He}{F0.She} beats a hasty exit and the aliens rejoice!</Text>
  <Text Key="6CF8C52C">“Don’t shoot! We surrender.” The Rebel leader doesn’t even have shoes, let alone weapons. {0.SimFirstName} is almost disappointed {M0.his}{F0.her} job is so easily completed! {M0.He}{F0.She} brings Yang Holmby the news and is rewarded handsomely for doing the government’s dirty work.</Text>
  <Text Key="B0A7B96F">{0.SimFirstName} comes across a purple specimen that seems to be breathing! Or maybe quivering? It's hard to tell, but it's moving at least. Suddenly, {M0.he}{F0.she} feels the whole ship shudder and rumble. Keep looking, or leave now?</Text>
  <Text Key="7BA828BD">The instant {0.SimFirstName} picks up a talisman, the ground starts rumbling. It’s a trap! Covering {M0.his}{F0.her} head, {M0.he}{F0.she} bolts from the temple just as the walls give way. {M0.He}{F0.She} makes it to {M0.his}{F0.her} ship and manages to get it airborne, but the ship has suffered critical damage. Although {0.SimFirstName} got {M0.his}{F0.her} artifact, this is going to be a rough landing.</Text>
  <Text Key="D9A8FB55">By showing {M0.his}{F0.her} softer side, {0.SimFirstName} has won back the respect of the people, but obviously this "alien overlord" stuff isn't exactly {M0.his}{F0.her} strong suit. "It's not you, it's me," {M0.he}{F0.she} tells the panicked aliens, heading back to {M0.his}{F0.her} ship.</Text>
  <Text Key="C106B317">Reversing back through the flotsam, the rocket drifts like a time-salmon against the relentless river of causality until it is surrounded by wreckage. What happened here?</Text>
  <Text Key="529E8006">Why slow down now? Fully engaging {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters, {0.SimFirstName} easily ditches the patrol. 4 Eyes is over the literal moon with excitement, but {0.SimFirstName} knows it's time to take {M0.his}{F0.her} friend home. {M0.He}{F0.She} even receives a nice reward from its mom as thanks. What a crazy Flea Market day!</Text>
  <Text Key="5EE189CD">The reptilians guide {0.SimFirstName} out of the nebula, but then come around to board {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket! Two towering Iguanoids pry open the hatch and rummage through {M0.his}{F0.her} things. Apparently {0.SimFirstName} doesn't have anything of value to them. They smash some panels and leave {0.SimFirstName} to {M0.his}{F0.her} broken devices.</Text>
  <Text Key="C4FE3BD6">That safest way to travel! As the drives activate, a flash of light flips the time polarity! {0.SimFirstName} is going the right way again, and needs to keep the time-stream intact! What should {M0.he}{F0.she} do?!</Text>
  <Text Key="E48267D5">Deciding it must be a trap, {0.SimFirstName} cruises on, but soon {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel starts to run low. The radar still hasn’t picked up anything but the planet on the map. {0.SimFirstName} has little choice. Re-directing {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, {M0.he}{F0.she} lands in front of a lone tree growing on a cliff. The opening to a small tunnel lies beneath it. Go in?</Text>
  <Text Key="63A33D5D">Ah, that's better. See? {0.SimFirstName}'s fine. If {M0.he}{F0.she} really had Space Madness {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} start to panic randomly and make really bad decisions. OH NO!! The rocket's too HEAVY!! {0.SimFirstName} should start ejecting things immediately!</Text>
  <Text Key="CE0554B9">{0.SimFirstName} is getting nowhere. The alien's explanation is as half-baked as the one before, possibly even quarter-baked. {M0.He}{F0.She} decides this is {M0.his}{F0.her} chance and lunges for the animal.</Text>
  <Text Key="A90AFA11">Abort! Abort! The rocket was programmed to land on soft cheese, but instead landed on hard rock! This was an understandable miscalculation, but nonetheless the ship is crippled; the landing back home might be a bit tricky...</Text>
  <Text Key="44D972CF">In a surprising reversal of fortune for the space pirates, {0.SimFirstName} blows open their cargo hold with a well-aimed spazerbeam. Looks like there's some decently valuable junk in there too! {0.SimFirstName} quickly collects what {M0.he}{F0.she} can and blasts off for home.</Text>
  <Text Key="9AB7AFFD">That tank must have been tampered with!  {M0.He}{F0.She} knew there was something fishy going on.{0.SimFirstName} puts the tank in the air lock and jets it into space. A few minutes later {M0.he}{F0.she} sees an empty air tank float by {M0.his}{F0.her} window. How did that get there? Is someone following {M0.him}{F0.her}? Is it some kind of listening device?</Text>
  <Text Key="57A7D93C">"Space madness," {0.SimFirstName} carefully enunciates into the comm. "You have selected: Self Destruct," the voice says, "Remotely engaging your ship's self destruct funtion now."</Text>

The Northern Lights!! {0.SimFirstName} can't spend the whole space day cooped up inside like this! {M0.He}{F0.She} needs to get out there and enjoy the beautiful weather! {M0.He}{F0.She} ventures toward the air lock and gets ready to go outside and take a nice walk.</Text>
  <Text Key="DAB39B4F">Oh hecks no, {0.SimFirstName}'s not getting on that ship. That's how sci-fi/horror movies start! Odds are, there's nothing on there but rogue viruses, hibernating alien monsters, or something even more horrible. {M0.He}{F0.She} gathers a few pipes and widgets from the outside and gets away before anything terrible can happen.</Text>
  <Text Key="FF90F72C">{0.SimFirstName}'s never seen rocks like this before! As {M0.he}{F0.she}'s shoving rocks into {M0.his}{F0.her} pockets, the ship starts violently shuddering and breaking apart. {0.SimFirstName} makes it back to the rocket, but a piece of debris hits the back fender, damaging it severely. {F0.She}{M0.He}'ll have to hope that it's spaceworthy for the journey home.</Text>
  <Text Key="FDD62D44">Diplomacy first, {0.SimFirstName} always says, and this time it actually works! The colonists only have small demands—a tiny raise in wages, the ability to gather and discuss ideas—but they quickly drop the wage increase to reunite with their government. At the Celebration, everyone enjoys free soup and {0.SimFirstName} is rewarded handsomely for {M0.his}{F0.her} efforts.</Text>
  <Text Key="1F64252B">Each specimen is weirder and more breathtaking than the last. One looks like a preserved alien with gills AND a nose! As {0.SimFirstName}'s putting the jar in {F0.her}{M0.his} pocket, the ship starts violently shaking. Time to go! As {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back on {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket, {0.SimFirstName} feels the ship start breaking apart. Some debris hits the thrusters.... Hope the ship makes it home okay.</Text>
  <Text Key="9A623EF7">{0.SimFirstName} scans the tank with {M0.his}{F0.her} special micronoscope, and sees the serial number…it's from {M0.his}{F0.her} own ship! Whoa, this is crazy. How did it get outside? </Text>
  <Text Key="3F9EDD9D">Oh no! {0.SimFirstName}'s bad aim has blasted off part of the satellite! Surely everyone's data plan is going to blow up, and OMG, those roaming charges! If only {0.SimFirstName} were more focused!</Text>
  <Text Key="29E47B88">{0.SimFirstName} can already feel the force of the black hole sucking {M0.his}{F0.her} ship closer. No time to waste! Securing the alien spaceship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket with titanium cable, {M0.he}{F0.she} crosses {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers and engages {M0.his}{F0.her} thrusters. Yes! It works. The pilot is so thrilled to have his ship safe, he awards {0.SimFirstName} his most valuable cargo. Score!</Text>
  <Text Key="74AE3BB4">{0.SimFirstName} knows it’s best not to mess with the law in this quadrant. Besides, someone could have planted the kid just for an excuse to attack. The space cops pick up 4 Eyes and take it home, offering {0.SimFirstName} a small reward for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble.</Text>
  <Text Key="00EF852A">Once in orbit, {0.SimFirstName} gets an odd message from the International Sims Space Station. It's badly garbled and makes little sense. {0.SimFirstName} decides to fly over and check it out.</Text>
  <Text Key="879BFBF0">As {0.SimFirstName} draws closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} realizes that it's an alien spacecraft piloted by a 3-eyed, 16-tentacled alien, who is grinning too much to be in real distress. Claiming to be the best starfighter in the universe, the alien challenges {M0.him}{F0.her} to a duel and offers a substantial reward. Does {0.SimFirstName} accept?</Text>
  <Text Key="FD2CDE21">Error - Error!  !rorrE -rorrE --  After a perilous journey to the deepest, darkest, edges of space and time, {0.SimFirstName} has ricocheted off of the edge of TIME ITSELF, and is now retracing {F0.her}{M0.his} sojourn in reverse! The rocket is backing into a debris field; what happened here?</Text>
  <Text Key="654CBD25">Grasping the pipe tighter, {0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door and swings wildly. Just then, something soft and squishy thumps onto {M0.his}{F0.her} back and a tentacle threads around {M0.his}{F0.her} neck. “Don’t move!” a small voice whispers. Everything goes black. {0.SimFirstName} faints, which is technically moving.</Text>
  <Text Key="A3831739">The aliens give thanks, but they're a little miffed. What kind of deity would let {M0.his}{F0.her} people suffer that way? They lose faith. Soon, the prayers stop and the tiny civilization just ignores {0.SimFirstName} entirely. During the long flight home {M0.he}{F0.she} can reflect on the ramifications of power.</Text>
  <Text Key="FE9E97F9">Good thing {0.SimFirstName} invested in those trusty Ion Cannons. With a few well-placed blasts, the Cosmic Relief fighter is completely disabled. Fitzy-Poo, it's time to head home.</Text>
  <Text Key="29ADEF66">Yeehaw! Nothing like a wide-eyed kid to make {0.SimFirstName} feel like a hero. Kicking {M0.his}{F0.her} ship into hyperwarp, {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts loops around Planet Toomootoo—until suddenly lights appear in the distance. Space cops! {0.SimFirstName} could pull over and try to explain, or try to outrun them.</Text>
  <Text Key="3CA53CDC">{0.SimFirstName} makes an admirable attempt to communicate {M0.his}{F0.her} situation through a series of wild hand gestures and earnest facial expressions. The creature mumbles something in a bizarre language and hands over the part! {0.SimFirstName} can return home! ({M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} never know it, but the alien said {M0.he}{F0.she} reminded it of {M0.an uncle}{F0.an aunt} it had back on Grzypllflotz.)</Text>
  <Text Key="ADE4B26A">They want water? {0.SimFirstName} will give them water - {M0.he}{F0.she} fills a bucket full of water and dumps it all over their colony so that it floods their fields. Power is fun, huh, {0.SimFirstName}? What's next?</Text>
  <Text Key="924939B0">{0.SimFirstName} is filling up on rocket fuel when an alien spacecraft pulls up to the pump next to {M0.him}{F0.her}. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't think much of it until {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the alien loading crates onto {M0.his}{F0.her} ship! “The space police are after me!” the alien shouts. “Hide this stuff! I promise I'll make it worth it!”</Text>
  <Text Key="878F0415">Eh, {0.SimFirstName} has had {M0.his}{F0.her} fun. And these aliens have learned a valuable lesson about something...probably. {0.SimFirstName} returns to the ship, leaving the tiny civilization to its own devices until the next "supreme being" makes a rest stop.</Text>
  <Text Key="5C3D3A91">{0.SimFirstName} cruises around picking up all the space junk {M0.he}{F0.she} can find. As it turns out, there is a LOT of junk up here, and the cabin is quickly too full to move in, so {0.SimFirstName} heads home. As {M0.he}{F0.she} re-enters the atmosphere, the Space Madness wears off. "Where did all this junk come from?" {0.SimFirstName} wonders.</Text>
  <Text Key="1C0FD80D">Luckily the police captain seems to be into {0.SimFirstName}. With a dash of charm and some crafty fast-talk, {0.SimFirstName} distracts the cop from performing a thorough search, and the police are gone in no time. Now {0.SimFirstName} just has to find {M0.his}{F0.her} alien friend!</Text>
  <Text Key="8D7E629F">The aliens are pushing some pebbles around and desperately trying to start a farm on a large pile of mold. {0.SimFirstName} can only think of two kinds of deities: the loving, benevolent kind and the angry, jealous kind.</Text>
  <Text Key="464D771B">{0.SimFirstName} crashes through the hold door, shouting. Something small and orange scampers behind a crate. Scanning the room, {0.SimFirstName} sees that a display for a taxidermied alien {M0.he}{F0.she} found is empty! “Don’t hurt me!” a tiny voice cries. Four eyes peek from behind the crate. {0.SimFirstName} lowers the pipe.</Text>
  <Text Key="37F60C9A">Mayday! Mayday! {0.SimFirstName} is cruising through space when {M0.he}{F0.she} receives a distress call from another ship. {M0.He}{F0.She} can’t make out everything the pilot is saying, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does have a clear reading on its location. {M0.He}{F0.She} sets a course to save them.</Text>
  <Text Key="264FE412">It seems fairly obvious at this point that the crew has completely lost their marbles. {0.SimFirstName} sneaks through the fight and grabs the box of food, hiding it away so they won't waste it. {0.SimFirstName} returns to the rocket and contacts command, who will send a rescue party of trained professionals soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="73F4DDA9">{0.SimFirstName} smacks {M0.his}{F0.her} comm system again. Ever since {M0.he}{F0.she} arrived in space, {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been experiencing tons of interference in {M0.his}{F0.her} radio communications. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} about to phone tech support when {M0.he}{F0.she} sees it: the fifth solar flare in the last half hour. That explains it! {0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} better go investigate.</Text>
  <Text Key="F89C266F">Rattle—rattle—crash! {0.SimFirstName} is on the way back from the Comet ESON Flea Market when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears banging inside {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship’s cargo hold. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks back through recent salvage efforts … nothing living, certainly. Should {0.SimFirstName} call out, or try to take whatever it is by surprise?</Text>
  <Text Key="95B1E024">{0.SimFirstName} discovers the planet is a giant landfill—a junkyard for broken spacecraft and discarded instruments. {M0.He}{F0.She} has just enough time to collect a few treasures before finding a safe route home.</Text>
  <Text Key="C3F03DA7">"Oh why has thou forsaken us?" cry the aliens. But {0.SimFirstName} just laughs maniacally and continues to be capriciously evil.</Text>
  <Text Key="BBE579B4">All of a sudden, {0.SimFirstName} sees a big shadow. {M0.He}{F0.She} quickly looks to see a giant pastry freezer bunny floating by. It looks like it has its eyes focused on another satellite and starts to shoot pink frosting!</Text>
  <Text Key="8651BB85">{0.SimFirstName} is gliding through the galaxy when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a constellation {M0.he}{F0.she} has never seen before. Double-checking {M0.his}{F0.her} coordinates {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is not where {M0.he}{F0.she} thought at all. What’s more, {M0.his}{F0.her} ship’s GPS (Galactic Positioning System) has gone black. {M0.He}{F0.She} is lost in space!</Text>
  <Text Key="DC95B7DE">{0.SimFirstName} dives into the ship and snaps the door shut seconds before the beast slams into the rocket’s side. Safely inside the ship, {0.SimFirstName} can dress {M0.his}{F0.her} wounds and effect the needed repairs to the port compression coil. It’s time to head home.</Text>
  <Text Key="69DA7B4B">The asteroid smashes into the ship with the force of giant chunk of rock that's been hurtling through space. Luckily, it shatters, but the ship shudders from the impact. It might be rough getting home!</Text>
  <Text Key="C73690F7">Deep in the Evil Cave, {0.SimFirstName} encounters {M0.his}{F0.her} ultimate challenge: Nega-{0.SimFirstName}!! And {0.SimFirstName} has no weapons! Luckily, after explaining the situation, Nega-{0.SimFirstName} agrees to just pretend like {0.SimFirstName} defeated {M0.him}{F0.her} so {0.SimFirstName} can go home. Turns out Nega-{0.SimFirstName} is pretty cool. Now to see if that funny creature can get the ship out of the swamp!</Text>
  <Text Key="883AFED7">{0.SimFirstName} studies the aliens closely - they appear to want more water to grow their crops. The loving, benevolent thing to do would be to give it to them, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="B47BF864">Without the super ion cannons, the blasts bounce right off of the bunny! The angry bunny turns toward {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, but luckily {M0.he}{F0.she} gets away!</Text>
  <Text Key="03774F38">After double-checking Fitz’s photo in the {M0.men’s room}{F0.ladies’ room}, {0.SimFirstName} asks the alien where the red leash came from. Indignant, the alien begins to swell and turn yellow, then presses a button under the desk. A guard appears with a long, shiny needle and seizes {0.SimFirstName}.</Text>
  <Text Key="756FEEE8">{0.SimFirstName} retrieves a treasure from the rocket’s storage, dons {F0.her}{M0.his} spacesuit and backs into a space-moonwalk. {F0.She}{M0.He} leaves the treasure where it was found, and returns. What happened just before?</Text>
  <Text Key="2D6D76D2">{0.SimFirstName} studies the aliens closely--they appear to want more water to grow their crops. But {M0.he's}{F0.she's} an angry, jealous deity, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to test them a little.</Text>
  <Text Key="9FBA240A">Well, that didn’t work. {0.SimFirstName} thought {M0.his}{F0.her} story about losing {M0.his}{F0.her} mutt was rather convincing—{M0.he}{F0.she} even mustered a tear—but the alien isn’t letting {M0.him}{F0.her} past the desk. She can search the computer for recent records or take down {M0.his}{F0.her} info. {0.SimFirstName} agrees to the search to buy time.</Text>
  <Text Key="E7DE565A">{0.SimFirstName} is escorted down a long hallway by a grumpy-looking guard. He shoves {0.SimFirstName} into an examination room and explains that {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} need a rabies shot if  {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to get near the animals. Does {0.SimFirstName} agree to the injection?</Text>
  <Text Key="29144814">{0.SimFirstName} calls out. No answer. The only sound is a soft dripping. {M0.He}{F0.She} treads quietly into the tunnel—but suddenly everything goes black. {M0.He}{F0.She} whirls, flipping on {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty headlamp. Eyes glow in the narrow beam—not two, but hundreds. {0.SimFirstName} can try to talk {M0.his}{F0.her} way out of this, or run like crazy.</Text>
  <Text Key="98B978FD">{0.SimFirstName} picks up a piece of metal pipe and shouts, “Anybody there?” The rattling stops. Silence. {M0.He}{F0.She} calls again. Again there’s no response. Whatever’s in there doesn’t want to be found. {0.SimFirstName} has two choices: {M0.he}{F0.she} can brace the door shut, or go in swinging.</Text>
  <Text Key="BB32DF18">Dog Girl must not have any greyhound in her. {0.SimFirstName} easily keeps pace and manages to eke past her in the final lap to pull off the win! Prize money in hand, {M0.he}{F0.she} hightails it out of there, careful to ditch any disgruntled losers before heading home.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0D5CAA6">{0.SimFirstName} is off to an excellent start! Rounding the 105th bend, {M0.he}{F0.she} reassesses {M0.his}{F0.her} position in the pack. The dog girl is giving {M0.him}{F0.her} a run for {M0.his}{F0.her} money, and Red Tooth isn’t far behind. Should {0.SimFirstName} rattle Dog Girl’s confidence by stepping on it, or hang back and keep pace until the final laps?</Text>
  <Text Key="6D1C78EE">Right, that’s what happened! {0.SimFirstName} botches {M0.his}{F0.her} attempt at diplomacy again, and a skirmish ensues, {0.SimFirstName} the valiant winner. Avoiding the time-edge this time around, {0.SimFirstName} returns home a hero.</Text>
  <Text Key="1E57D634">What's that up ahead? {0.SimFirstName} cruises over for a closer look and sees a hulking old ship. It's flying a flag with a spacecash symbol, which is the intergalactic symbol for commerce. It's a trader ship that wants to do business. {0.SimFirstName} begins the docking procedure.</Text>
  <Text Key="D2EBD74A">{0.SimFirstName} is just about to beat {M0.his}{F0.her} personal best time around planet Daiscot when a Comm Alert breaks {M0.his}{F0.her} concentration. It’s Dispatch, requesting assistance with a civil dispute on Hiattooine. Itching for a change of scene, {0.SimFirstName} agrees to the mission and blasts over to see what’s what.</Text>
  <Text Key="488516BD">It isn’t easy to get the alien’s attention—until {0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} ion cannons to blast some rocks from his stash. Spooked, the alien jets away in his flying saucer, squealing at the top of its lung-thingies. The interference stops, and {0.SimFirstName} gets some free space rocks for {M0.his}{F0.her} trouble!</Text>
  <Text Key="737ED1BD">No luck! {0.SimFirstName} gives the Cosmic Relief fighter a good chase, but it eventually disables one of {M0.his}{F0.her} engines and {M0.he}{F0.she} is forced to return Fitz in the PoochPod they send over. {0.SimFirstName} will have to watch the black market for him—assuming {M0.his}{F0.her} remaining engine can get {M0.him}{F0.her} home.</Text>
  <Text Key="735D0FF4">The instant {0.SimFirstName} opens the ship door, the animals swarm {M0.him}{F0.her}! Rethinking {M0.his}{F0.her} approach, {M0.he}{F0.she} opens a portal near the rocket’s tip and tosses out a juicy filet mignon, deftly seasoned with tranquilizers. The biggest beast seizes it, swallows it and promptly keels over. With a little help from {M0.his}{F0.her} trusty grappler, {0.SimFirstName} has the perfect alien specimen!</Text>
  <Text Key="623889E8">Stupid ship! Stupid air! Why won't this spaceship window OPEN?! It must be a conspiracy... Well {0.SimFirstName} isn't going to let them get {M0.him}{F0.her} that easily. It'll all be okay if {M0.he}{F0.she} can just get this window open!!</Text>
  <Text Key="8BCE13F4">"What's wrong with this civilization!?" {0.SimFirstName} yells. {M0.He}{F0.She} gives the aliens a piece of {M0.his}{F0.her} mind and then walks off in a huff. Despite all the nice things {M0.he}{F0.she} did for them, it looks like {M0.he}{F0.she}'ll be remembered as a despot. As {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket ship heads for home, the alien historians begin writing of these dark, troubled times.</Text>
  <Text Key="F7F04EDA">{0.SimFirstName} is soaring through the outer reaches of space when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices an insanely bright—something—glowing below {M0.him}{F0.her}. As {M0.he}{F0.she} swings in closer, {M0.he}{F0.she} hears engines revving and realizes: it’s an interstellar race track! There’s a prize for the winner, but these contestants are no joke. {0.SimFirstName} better be sure {M0.his}{F0.her} ship is up to it. Join the race?</Text>
  <Text Key="3DDC45BC">After double-checking Fitz’s photo in the {M0.men’s room}{F0.ladies’ room}, {0.SimFirstName} asks the alien about the leash. Flustered, the alien begins to swell and turn yellow, but insists it came from a solar cat they had recently captured. Just then, {0.SimFirstName} hears a whimper from beneath the desk. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} make a grab for the animal or wait for an explanation?</Text>
  <Text Key="514FC00A">An asteroid is rocketing towards the planet! What is {0.SimFirstName} going to do?!</Text>
  <Text Key="67AD6EC0">{0.SimFirstName} sends a message of peace to the creature, who responds by flashing bright red. Suddenly, a much bigger plumbob creature appears around the side of the asteroid, looking quite angry. Does {0.SimFirstName} attempt to fight the creature, or flee?</Text>
  <Text Key="8831B35A">Sure enough, the map leads {0.SimFirstName} to a charred-looking planet with a lone tree growing from a cliff. At first glance the place seems abandoned, but then {M0.he}{F0.she} notices the opening to a small tunnel beneath the tree. Go in?</Text>
  <Text Key="8F18E884">Well, if smiting is what the people want....{0.SimFirstName} starts squashing some of the offenders with {M0.his}{F0.her} thumb or brushing them into the trash. But now all of the aliens are terrified of {M0.him}{F0.her}! {0.SimFirstName}'s losing their goodwill!</Text>
  <Text Key="3BEA089F">Yes! Those amazing ion cannons blast off the pastry bunny’s arm. A new arm starts to regenerate, but the bunny seems to have learned its lesson and floats off into space.</Text>
  <Text Key="B538E905">{0.SimFirstName} tries to shove all the stuff into the cargo bay, but they hear a terrible CRUNCH - the alien's terrarium just shattered. Oops. Since he has nowhere to put his prized "pet," he gives it to {0.SimFirstName} as payment for the ride. "His name is Bandit," says the alien.</Text>
  <Text Key="663D19E2">{0.SimFirstName} is almost out the door when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears a chorus of tiny, beseeching voices. Surely it couldn't hurt to hear one or two prayers, right? When else will {0.SimFirstName} get the chance?</Text>
  <Text Key="E65875AB">The ship's blasters don't even make a dent on the rock. {0.SimFirstName} has no choice but to block the asteroid with the ship!</Text>
  <Text Key="FFF5A403">“Time for the first trial, it is,” rasps the creature, “Pick a number between one and ten.” “Four,” says {0.SimFirstName}. “Well done. Now, the second trial…” Hey, this is easy! The creature continues, “Make me some lunch, you will.” {0.SimFirstName} could forage in the surrounding jungle, or there might be some kind of fish in the swamp?</Text>
  <Text Key="7532F665">{0.SimFirstName} quietly follows the creature. {F0.She}{M0.He} notices that the alien changes colors in a certain pattern, seemingly as a way to communicate. Eventually, the creature flies away.</Text>
  <Text Key="580B5B58">To the east, a jagged series of rocks stabs upward toward the alien sky. It looks like a cross between a mountain range and a pile of shrapnel. {0.SimFirstName} can see a lone curl of smoke rising from one of the peaks. To the west, the valley looks much easier to traverse but there are no obvious signs of life.</Text>
  <Text Key="12C1E662">The asteroid shatters into fragments which burn up harmlessly into the atmosphere. {0.SimFirstName} is able to grab some fragments that blasted loose.</Text>
  <Text Key="FAE16FAD">{0.SimFirstName} is off on another amazing adventure in space! Or, {M0.he}{F0.she} would be if {M0.his}{F0.her} ship were actually moving, which it is not. An error message on the main control screen informs {M0.him}{F0.her} that the ship's dynotherm drivers need to be updated.</Text>
  <Text Key="D94835F9">That’s not what happened! A chrono-shock chrono-rocks the spaceship, sending it home in tatters!</Text>
  <Text Key="4FB8077F">The Green Man</Text>
  <Text Key="8A48DFF1">As the rocket sinks another inch into the swamp, {0.SimFirstName} suddenly spies a funny little green man hobbling over to {M0.him}{F0.her}. Amazingly, the creature speaks perfect Simlish! “Help you, I can,” he rasps. Well, almost perfect Simlish. He offers to raise {0.SimFirstName}’s ship from the swamp if {M0.he}{F0.she} can pass certain trials. {0.SimFirstName} agrees.</Text>

  <Text Key="9ADEFD18">Bad news! The probe can't traverse the lunar landscape! Also, it isn't gathering any data! Additionally, it may actually be a space-espresso machine and not a probe at all! Looks like {0.SimFirstName} is going home empty-handed.</Text>
  <Text Key="54559FA8">There is just enough light left for {0.SimFirstName} to make out a large camp, but whoever was staying here appears to have left for safer shelter. Turning toward the sound of a deep growl, {M0.he}{F0.she} spies a pack of monstrous beasts sniffing the ground not far away. This planet isn’t safe. {0.SimFirstName} decides to attempt the flight home without the replacement part.</Text>
  <Text Key="015395C9">{0.SimFirstName} successfully punches out the window with an old wrench, but the pressure change starts sucking everything out of the cabin! Luckily a replacement window gets wedged into the hole and seals it. Wow! The ship automatically cycles in the reserve air and {0.SimFirstName}'s head finally clears. Better get home for repairs!</Text>
  <Text Key="A216881E">{0.SimFirstName} engages Safe Mode and the dynotherms immediately explode out of the ship. That hardly seems safe at all! However, it does clear the error message and that's what's important. Unfortunately, landing with a minor engine breach and no dynotherms is insanely dangerous...</Text>
  <Text Key="E752773A">After an hour of searching, {0.SimFirstName} lamely offers up a couple of twigs. The creature shakes his head. “You have failed the trial. Help you, I will not.” The only option now is to fire up the engines and go for full burn to clear the muck. There’s no telling what damage that could do to the ship, though…</Text>
  <Text Key="693C0325">They'll never catch {0.SimFirstName}! NEVER!! {M0.He'll}{F0.She'll} double back home while they're searching the cosmos. With a clever grin, {0.SimFirstName} sets an orbit around a planet that is completely not {M0.his}{F0.her} homeworld. Hopefully a passing ship will give {M0.him}{F0.her} a tow eventually...</Text>
  <Text Key="61367BA6">{0.SimFirstName} attempts to manually connect the dynotherms, which causes them to explode magnificently. Parts of the engine that were never meant to be exposed to space are now exposed to space. This could potentially cause problems with re-entry…</Text>
  <Text Key="AA4840B9">{0.SimFirstName} puts together… something… from a collection of random parts around the station. Unfortunately, the only thing it produces is a sparky surprise and the faint smell of burning. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes and uses the rocket's radio to call for some real help.</Text>
  <Text Key="B9640BF6">{0.SimFirstName} is a pro at putting {M0.his}{F0.her} butt into butt-reception areas! {F0.She}{M0.He} sits down without incident, and the crowd goes wild! But they’re not cheering, they’re laughing. The pedestal/chair/{0.SimFirstName} ensemble sinks into the floor just like the other tests! {0.SimFirstName} is swallowed by the machination, dumped unceremoniously into {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket, and blasted home. What a mean trick!</Text>
  <Text Key="BC0DE676">Armed with a gallon of Chartreuse Charm and some wadded-up toilet paper, {0.SimFirstName} gets to work painting. But after inhaling the fumes for a few minutes a weird thing happens - {M0.he}{F0.she} feels the Space Madness lifting! While in {M0.his}{F0.her} moment of lucidity, {M0.he}{F0.she} charts a course for home and locks in the autopilot!</Text>
  <Text Key="3FBEB215">No time to waste! The black hole is already sucking {0.SimFirstName}’s rocketship toward certain destruction. Securing the alien ship to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocket, {M0.he}{F0.she} crosses {M0.his}{F0.her} fingers and pulls. Argh! The force is too strong. The cable snaps and a piece is torn from {0.SimFirstName}’s rocket. {M0.He}{F0.She} blasts {M0.his}{F0.her} engines again and escapes, but landing will be another story...</Text>
  <Text Key="5E03E7EE">{0.SimFirstName} turns {M0.his}{F0.her} ship around and hightails it out of there. Maybe it would be better to study the creature some more before attempting to talk to it.</Text>
  <Text Key="F86D79DC">"Another trick!" {0.SimFirstName} thinks as the gems glitter and sparkle, tantalizingly close. The alien beings look at each other in confusion. Does {M0.he}{F0.she} not know the value of what is being presented? A buzzer, unmistakingly indicating failure, sounds, and {0.SimFirstName} is zapped abruptly back onto {F0.her}{M0.his} spaceship, no riches to be had.</Text>
  <Text Key="DDF1956D">{0.SimFirstName} always has been a good talker, and lies are easier when they contain a smidgen of truth. Explaining about the broken GPS, {M0.he}{F0.she} leads the spider-like creatures toward {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship. Sure enough, the screen is still black. Muttering, an alien technician climbs aboard and slams it 3 times. Magic! {0.SimFirstName} enters {M0.his}{F0.her} home coordinates and clears out fast.</Text>
  <Text Key="7ABFF0BB">After breathing from the rescue tank for a few minutes, {0.SimFirstName} feels clearer and less crazy. That was close. And if {M0.he}{F0.she} goes back to breathing regular air, the symptoms will just come back, so {0.SimFirstName} decides to cut {M0.his}{F0.her} trip short and head back home early.</Text>
  <Text Key="A4515D1B">While the little creature is looking the other way {0.SimFirstName} reaches for the part, but as soon as {M0.he}{F0.she} touches it, a small, scaly hand grabs {M0.his}{F0.hers}! Slowly, the creature looks back at {0.SimFirstName} and hisses. The other creatures in the camp hiss and draw lethal-looking blades. No choice! {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to make a run for it and fly home without the part!</Text>
  <Text Key="1D388F79">Out in the blackness of deep space, {0.SimFirstName}'s body starts reacting to the pressure differential microscopically. The pressure vortex actually equalizes {0.SimFirstName}'s brain waves! The Space Madness is gone! {M0.He's}{F0.She's} clear-headed again and sets a course for home. This time, {M0.he}{F0.she} locks the ship into autopilot, just in case.</Text>
  <Text Key="FCC426ED">One swift kick from {0.SimFirstName}'s moon boot, and the alien flies into the airlock, where it is ejected into deep space. As it floats away, it makes some very rude gestures. Well, that kind of attitude certainly has no place on {0.SimFirstName}'s ship!</Text>
  <Text Key="3915F891">{0.SimFirstName} doesn't know what happens to people who stick around in situations like this, because those people are all dead. {M0.He'd}{F0.She'd} really prefer not to be one of them, so {M0.he}{F0.she} hops into {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket and blasts off before this turns into a bad horror movie.</Text>
  <Text Key="E60B1984">Thank goodness {0.SimFirstName} brought that bottle of juice! {M0.He}{F0.She} chugs it down to help with the pain. But a strange thing happens…the juice counteracts {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness, and {M0.he}{F0.she} becomes lucid again! {0.SimFirstName} has discovered the cure for Space Madness! {M0.He}{F0.She} heads home, wondering if there is any way to patent fruit juice!</Text>
  <Text Key="25875C93">{0.SimFirstName} finally staggers back to the ship, exhausted. Smacking the beast with a makeshift club had only made it angrier, and {0.SimFirstName} wound up leading it on quite a merry chase. {M0.He}{F0.She} finally managed to lose it, but the alien ship part was lost as well. Now to attempt the flight home without it…</Text>
  <Text Key="82D9C036">If {0.SimFirstName} thought the alien looked merry before, now {F0.she's}{M0.he's} in for the real special. Grinning from pointy green ear to pointy green ear, the creature chortles, catches another asteroid in the phase beam, and hurls it at {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, cracking a tail panel. He's reaching for another as {0.SimFirstName} blasts away at top speed. Hopefully, {M0.he}{F0.she} can still land....</Text>
  <Text Key="53784B20">It takes a while for {0.SimFirstName} to get the alien’s attention, but once {M0.he}{F0.she} does, the alien is quite reasonable about things. This seems to be his species' version of golf? Claiming he didn’t know it would mess up communication, he hands over his space rocks and goes on his way.</Text>
  <Text Key="7AA63BB5">Every light in {0.SimFirstName}'s cockpit is flashing, and every siren is blaring - the cargo is just too much! {0.SimFirstName} jettisons the extra poundage into space - the trader's going to be furious, but hopefully it helps {0.SimFirstName} make re-entry without any catastrophes...</Text>
  <Text Key="74F7CAB9">Phew! The cops believe {0.SimFirstName} and take {M0.his}{F0.her} little orange buddy home. Now {0.SimFirstName} can head home {M0.himself}{F0.herself} and wonder how a simple trip to the Flea Market got so out of control!</Text>
  <Text Key="468D4EE0">The wiring in this ship is almost definitely sending messages to the government. But now that it's all pulled out, the ship won't run! Oops. Still better than letting the men in trench coats start reading {M0.his}{F0.her} thoughts. {0.SimFirstName} is alone with {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness as {M0.he}{F0.she} waits for someone to tow {M0.him}{F0.her} back home...</Text>
  <Text Key="ED73620A">{0.SimFirstName} has just enough fuel to safely make it back home. Along the way, {M0.his}{F0.her} head starts clearing and the Space Madness starts lifting a bit. {M0.He}{F0.She} thinks back on the past several hours…this was a really, really strange trip.</Text>
  <Text Key="FC4848D8">{0.SimFirstName} gathers up some random garbage and debris and ejects it out into space. Now the area is littered with empty bottles and cellophane wrappers. That'll throw 'em off the scent. Quite pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} smarts and ingenuity, {0.SimFirstName} heads home.</Text>
  <Text Key="611EE859">{0.SimFirstName} points out {M0.he}{F0.she} could already be in trouble for alien-napping and stays {M0.his}{F0.her} course, assuming the little orange guy won’t have the guts to ask twice. Sure enough, the creature stays silent. Once they land, it quietly uncuffs {M0.him}{F0.her}, but smashes a panel angrily on its way out. Might be a rough flight home…</Text>
  <Text Key="F957EA2C">Rookie mistake! Without upgraded thrusters, {0.SimFirstName}’s ship can’t be pushed to those kinds of limits. Suddenly {M0.his}{F0.her} ship rattles violently and all systems sputter out! Spinning off the track, {M0.he}{F0.she} smashes into an asteroid. Luckily, the damage seems fixable, but it’ll be rough getting home.</Text>
  <Text Key="EEA84B66">{0.SimFirstName} knows exactly what to toss through that window: {M0.his}{F0.her} helmet!! The window is jarred from its frame but the pressure change starts sucking everything out of the cabin! Luckily a replacement window gets wedged into the hole and seals it. The ship automatically cycles in the reserve air and {0.SimFirstName}'s head finally clears. Better get home for repairs!</Text>
  <Text Key="A4143A4F">The guard seizes {0.SimFirstName} and injects {M0.him}{F0.her} anyway. When {0.SimFirstName} wakes up, {M0.he}{F0.she} is on the asphalt next to {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship. The Cosmic Relief Dog Pound is locked, and the only response to {M0.his}{F0.her} knocks is a lot of barking. Looks like it’s time to pack this mission in.</Text>
  <Text Key="5949B929">{0.SimFirstName} gets a lock on Red Tooth and fires, but the shot glances limply off the TS-555. Without better cannons, the most {M0.he}{F0.she} can hope to do to Red Tooth is irritate him. Snarling, Red Tooth rams {0.SimFirstName} off the track, damaging part of {M0.his}{F0.her} left wing. It’s gonna be a rough flight back.</Text>
  <Text Key="E81473CA">As {0.SimFirstName} blasts off home, {M0.he}{F0.she} assures {M0.himself}{F0.herself} that it was probably for the best. Racing can be dangerous without upgraded gear … though {M0.he}{F0.she} could definitely use that prize money.</Text>
  <Text Key="21939F93">This space walk is going to be amazing! {0.SimFirstName} puts on {M0.his}{F0.her} suit - along with its auxiliary air tank. After a few minutes of breathing clean air, {M0.he}{F0.she} regains {M0.his}{F0.her} sanity and realizes what happened. {M0.He}{F0.She} decides to stay in the suit and just head for home. Luckily {M0.he}{F0.she} didn't do anything too crazy!</Text>
  <Text Key="6A88B41E">After entering the wrong code too many times, {M0.he's}{F0.she's} locked out. {0.SimFirstName} sulks, complaining about enemy agents and hidden messages being broadcast in {M0.his}{F0.her} TV. But wait - those things aren't real! The Space Madness finally seems to be passing! {0.SimFirstName} realizes how irrational {M0.he's}{F0.she's} been and heads for home before another attack hits.</Text>
  <Text Key="DB7FF322">{0.SimFirstName} is attempting to take one small step, but for unknown reasons is unable to take that step. Stomping, waving {M0.his}{F0.her} arms, and shouting at the sky, though standard protocol, are proving ineffectual. It appears a small rock is in the way! {0.SimFirstName} cannot reach the surface.</Text>
  <Text Key="6FD72AD3">Sunset Valley, we have a problem! Like a poor-man's Icarus, {0.SimFirstName} flew too close to the moon, and has slingshot {F0.her}{M0.his} rocket up to perilous reentry speeds! {F0.She}{M0.He} should come plummeting home any minute now.</Text>
  <Text Key="C8A95726">{0.SimFirstName} fires {F0.her}{M0.his} ship's blasters, which bounce harmlessly off the surface of the creature. Oops. The creature slams into the ship, sending it careening. {0.SimFirstName} limps away back to home, with some bruises...</Text>
  <Text Key="AF164BCB">Luckily the police captain seems to be into {0.SimFirstName}. The cop believes {0.SimFirstName}'s story and takes the contraband without further questioning. The captain also rewards {0.SimFirstName} with a small stack of cash and a personal comm number--just in case {0.SimFirstName} needs anything. *Wink!*</Text>
  <Text Key="C1B1D755">{0.SimFirstName} recalls a nifty trick. Pursing {M0.his}{F0.her} lips, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets out a shrill alien mating cry. The egomaniac pilot turns 1 eye on the horizon and 1 on his mirror, but his 3rd eye spots {M0.him}{F0.her} coming! The alien dodges {0.SimFirstName}’s fire as the clock runs out. Telling {M0.him}{F0.her} to focus on upgrades, not stunts, the alien leaves {0.SimFirstName} to skulk home.</Text>
  <Text Key="FE08DC9D">Red lights flash and klaxons blare as the ship prepares to obliterate itself. Then everything goes calm, and with a small "ping" an error message appears. Apparently the drivers on the ship's Self Destruct need to be updated. Carefully clicking “Not Now,” {0.SimFirstName} vows to run a full system update as soon as {M0.he}{F0.she}'s safely back home.</Text>
  <Text Key="DED353EC">Though {0.SimFirstName} pushes really, REALLY hard, the triangular hole fails to accept the ball. Jeers erupt from the crowd, as the spectating beings exchange both sideways glances and lost wagers. Abruptly, {0.SimFirstName} is zapped back onto {M0.his}{F0.her} spaceship, already cruising towards home.</Text>
  <Text Key="238B37A7">Diplomacy first, {0.SimFirstName} always says, but this time it ain’t happening. The instant {M0.he}{F0.she} lands on the yellow moon, {M0.his}{F0.her} rocketship is surrounded by a mob of angry-looking colonists. They rock "the government {M0.man's}{F0.woman's}" rocket back and forth until it falls over, and race to their fighter ships. {0.SimFirstName} hopes {M0.he}{F0.she} can still get home safely.</Text>
  <Text Key="3957FDCF">Unfortunately, the police captain's no idiot. When {0.SimFirstName} turns on the charm, that only makes the officer more suspicious. The police find and confiscate the contraband, giving {0.SimFirstName} a stern warning to keep away from alien riff-raff. Relieved and refueled, {0.SimFirstName} blasts off for home.</Text>
  <Text Key="738FD55B">Ignoring the computer, {0.SimFirstName} manages to manually connect the dynotherms. {M0.He}{F0.She} always was good with machines! The error message clears. Now {0.SimFirstName} should be able to pilot the ship back home safely.</Text>
  <Text Key="95B2F60F">{0.SimFirstName} runs to the ship, but the pain in {M0.his}{F0.her} side is unbearable. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s not fast enough. As the rocket door opens, a nightmare in black fur pounces on {M0.him}{F0.her}! It’s all teeth and claws until {M0.he}{F0.she} manages to scramble into the ship. The wounds can be dressed, but {0.SimFirstName} will have to fly home without the catalyzer.</Text>
  <Text Key="77DA4FD4">"No worries, dude," says the alien. {0.SimFirstName} apologizes, but promises to help out next time. As {M0.he}{F0.she} blasts off for home, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the alien forlornly playing his didgeridoo as he fades into the distance. {0.SimFirstName} might want to consider getting that expanded cargo bay.</Text>
  <Text Key="BBFAF6C4">{0.SimFirstName} drops everything and runs! Dozens of spider-like aliens descend on {M0.him}{F0.her} and carry {M0.him}{F0.her}, roughly, back to the ship. An alien technician climbs aboard and programs something. {0.SimFirstName} finds {M0.himself}{F0.herself} rocketing toward home, hoping {M0.his}{F0.her} fuel will somehow last...</Text>
  <Text Key="D557A0F9">The pain spirits will be forestalled by the spastic gyrations of the dance, or so {0.SimFirstName} thinks. Through sheer luck {M0.his}{F0.her} random flailing actually activates the ship's emergency beacon. A rescue crew soon shows up to tow {0.SimFirstName} back into {M0.his}{F0.her} home orbit.</Text>
  <Text Key="7E0D1454">{0.SimFirstName} fires an ion blast at the creature’s stash of rocks—and misses! Grinning from ear to pointy green ear, the alien chortles, catches an asteroid in the phase beam and hurls it at {0.SimFirstName}’s ship, cracking a tail panel. He’s reaching for another as {0.SimFirstName} blasts away at top speed. Hopefully, the ship can still land…</Text>
  <Text Key="F93D555D">{0.SimFirstName}'s oxygen is down to fumes when a trader ship passes by and detects the signal from the beacon. {M0.He's}{F0.She's} saved! The ship's alien cook makes {M0.him}{F0.her} something like a grilled cheese while the ship's mechanic fixes the hull breach with his terrible foreclaws. Looks like {0.SimFirstName} lives to explore another day!</Text>
  <Text Key="8430C302">Why slow down now? {0.SimFirstName} accelerates past the red—but without thrusters {M0.his}{F0.her} engine bursts into flames. The cops tow {M0.him}{F0.her} back to the station, where they charge {M0.him}{F0.her} for alien-napping and endangering a minor. Hopefully {0.SimFirstName} can escape and make it back home from here…</Text>
  <Text Key="0AADA035">Wrong! The panel shuts down and the door won't open. {0.SimFirstName} has no choice but to drift aimlessly and hope a passing ship tows {M0.him}{F0.her} back home…</Text>
  <Text Key="64AC9439">{0.SimFirstName} really has been meaning to polish up on {M0.his}{F0.her} social skills. The little creature takes great offense to {0.SimFirstName}’s pleas. Suddenly, all of the creatures in the camp begin to hiss. They draw tiny but vicious-looking blades. This planet isn’t safe anymore. It’s not ideal, but {0.SimFirstName} will have to attempt the flight home without a new catalyzer!</Text>
  <Text Key="BCF746EA">{0.SimFirstName} opens the fuel valve and watches all {M0.his}{F0.her} propellant trickle out. Soon, the engines sputter and die. Now {M0.he's}{F0.she's} floating through deep space with no way to get home. The rocket automatically activates its distress beacon. Hopefully a friendly ship will stop by and give {0.SimFirstName} a tow…and some fresh oxygen.</Text>
  <Text Key="08B87873">As {0.SimFirstName} cruises deeper into space, the pressure differential causes a warping of {M0.his}{F0.her} brain's equilibrium centers. In short, {M0.his}{F0.her} Space Madness is cured! By science! {M0.He}{F0.She} realizes how bizarre {M0.he's}{F0.she's} been acting and flags a passing ship for help returning home.</Text>
  <Text Key="CBED0C74">Bad things happen when a person consumes 17 packages of astronaut mashed potatoes. But wait - {0.SimFirstName}'s slowly starting to feel sharper, more clear-headed…why did {M0.he}{F0.she} do so many weird things? {M0.He}{F0.She} must have had Space Madness! In case it comes back, {0.SimFirstName} heads for home immediately.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F881374">{0.SimFirstName} cautiously inspects the hat with an outstretched arm.  Who knows; it could have space-lice!  Murmurs through the crowd indicate that something is amiss.  They think {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t know how a hat works!  Before a rapid donning can ameliorate the confusion, {0.SimFirstName} is zapped back onto {F0.her}{M0.his} spaceship, which is already cruising towards home.</Text>
  <Text Key="53C334AD">The only thing {0.SimFirstName} catches from the muck is a swamp-borne disease. The trial is over, and the creature will not help {M0.him}{F0.her}. The only option now is to fire up the engines and go for full burn to clear the swamp. There’s no telling what damage that could do to the ship, though....</Text>
  <Text Key="64AECF44">With {0.SimFirstName}’s help, Hiattooine's food replicators begin launching non-grilled cheese—at hyperspeed! The Rebel forces are soon buried in disgusting sandwiches. {0.SimFirstName} is arrested along with them, and is forced to hand over the landing stabilizers on the rocket to secure {M0.his}{F0.her} release.</Text>
  <Text Key="74D266C5">{0.SimFirstName} hops into {M0.his}{F0.her} pod to go investigate, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets out there {M0.he}{F0.she} can't remember what {M0.he}{F0.she} was supposed to be doing. As it turns out, one of the symptoms of Space Madness is short-term memory loss. Bored, {0.SimFirstName} simply goes home.</Text>
  <Text Key="5B447DAF">Approching the crew, it becomes obvious from the look in their eyes that they have contracted space madness! Immediately, the astronauts begins pelting {0.SimFirstName} with food, forcing {M0.him}{F0.her} to flee back to the rocket. {0.SimFirstName} sends a message to command. Hopefully, they know what to do.</Text>
  <Text Key="072B40E4">It was an act of sheer optimism for {0.SimFirstName} to believe {M0.he}{F0.she} could decipher the workings of an alien spacecraft. {M0.He}{F0.She} isn’t very handy with machines anyway. The sun is starting to set and it won’t be safe to stay out any longer. {0.SimFirstName} will have to abandon the search and hope for the best on the flight home.</Text>
  <Text Key="559D101F">This has been a terrifying ordeal of deception and malevolence, and {0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn't even WANT to know who's been following {M0.him}{F0.her}. {M0.He}{F0.She} heads home as fast as the ship will go.</Text>
  <Text Key="DFAAF5B2">Orbiting the moon has proven a prudent, if boring choice! {0.SimFirstName} will surely join the annals of other Sims who've seen the moon from a closer distance; yes, those nearly brave heroes whose names no one can remember will surely be remembered forevermore.</Text>

  <Text Key="2D9DB396">{0.SimFirstName} dumps the moon rocks and agrees to take the new job, but the new client never shows up to meet her. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} been played! Now {0.SimFirstName}’s out a lot of cargo, {M0.his}{F0.her} old client is angry, and the new client is nowhere to be found.</Text>
  <Text Key="9C6C378A">Although the old client is angry at {0.SimFirstName} for dumping the moon rocks, the new job has a huge payday. {0.SimFirstName} comes out ahead, and the new client is now a regular client.</Text>

  <Text Key="0043764A">Aha! A faulty connector widget was causing the error messages-the panels are fine after all! Good thing {0.SimFirstName} checked them out.</Text>
  <Text Key="4E6799A9">Just because they’re expensive doesn’t mean they will last a long time or work well. Those panels are junk, and {0.SimFirstName} has to replace them all anyway.</Text>
  <Text Key="5E5A4361">Luckily, the new client has deep pockets. When {0.SimFirstName} delivers the dire chinchillas, he pays {M0.him}{F0.her} double the street value of the critters. And {0.SimFirstName} only suffered a few minor lacerations-no problem!</Text>
  <Text Key="C60D6074">The Glorzaks were just hanging out, and they appreciated that {0.SimFirstName} didn’t harass them. They share some xxulyps with {M0.him}{F0.her} (they’re like donuts) and give {M0.him}{F0.her} the inside scoop on what’s happening in this sector. Nice kids!</Text>
  <Text Key="BBDDA2D5">{0.SimFirstName} didn’t see the reports that young Glorzaks have been gathering weapons. Later, one of the boys in the group robs a spacemarket with a pocket laserblade. Could {0.SimFirstName} have prevented the crime?</Text>

Could it have been coded directions to a space treasure? {0.SimFirstName} will never know.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0B6E9B3">One of the kids had a laserblade in his pocket-supporting the buzz that young Glorzaks have been gathering weapons lately. Maybe now the Planet Patrol will be able to find and shut down their supplier.</Text>
  <Text Key="291F0078">When {0.SimFirstName} shows up at the rendezvous point with the dire chinchillas, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds half the Planet Patrol there-{M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been set up! {0.SimFirstName} quickly sets {M0.his}{F0.her} ferocious cargo on the Patrol agents and escapes, but {M0.he}{F0.she} has nothing to show for this job.</Text>
  <Text Key="193BD783">Everyone knows that customs is the worst-funded part of any government. The tiles sail through undetected and {0.SimFirstName} saves a lot of money.</Text>
  <Text Key="BDC191DC">As soon as the pilots start to use it, the system crashes. Now the pilots have to work twice as hard to drive the shuttle, and they tell everyone about {0.SimFirstName}’s dumb plan. {M0.He}{F0.She} is disciplined and forced to clean the lavatories as punishment. </Text>
  <Text Key="6E794157">The client would have paid some major Simoleons to move those dire space chinchillas, and now he’s not happy. He’s trash-talking {0.SimFirstName} all across the galaxy, and pledging all future business to {0.SimFirstName}’s closest competitor. Now {0.SimFirstName} will have to work twice as hard to turn a profit in this sector!</Text>
  <Text Key="16B77A3F">As soon as the pilots start using {0.SimFirstName}’s system, they realize how much easier {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} made things. The feedback on the system is so positive, no one cares that {M0.he}{F0.she} broke the rules.</Text>
  <Text Key="5824CC67">Better to finish the arrest in progress before charging off on another mission. A Flornaxian Fire Bird in the hand, etc... {0.SimFirstName} will focus on getting one evildoer off of the spacelanes, and let {M0.his}{F0.her} colleagues handle the bigger case.</Text>
  <Text Key="0408A7A8">Turns out the gangster was looking to clean up his act. Not a lot, of course, just enough to organize and expand his profits. {0.SimFirstName} could have been the one to lead that organization effort. Sounds like it would have been a pretty plush job!</Text>
  <Text Key="F3547DF4">Nobody listens to {0.SimFirstName}, and although {M0.he}{F0.she} collects some money in fines, the space jails and star courts are now filling up with litterbugs. The whole thing is becoming more trouble than it’s worth.</Text>
  <Text Key="3889EEEE">{M0.He}{F0.She} might have gotten a decent grade...if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} stayed awake through the whole exam. But {0.SimFirstName} was so exhausted that {M0.he}{F0.she} fell asleep right at {M0.his}{F0.her} desk. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} has to wait months to take the test again.</Text>
  <Text Key="35664B03">Sleep isn’t a substitute for actually knowing the answers. {0.SimFirstName} feels great, but {M0.he}{F0.she} still doesn’t know anything about Space Geography. {M0.He}{F0.She} fails, and it will be a while before {M0.he}{F0.she} can retake the test.</Text>
  <Text Key="5A5572E1">Out of the thousand crates in the warehouse, the customs inspector picks {0.SimFirstName}’s to open…he discovers the tiles and fines {0.SimFirstName} more money than {M0.he}{F0.she} would have spent on taxes in the first place.</Text>
  <Text Key="B503AD67">{0.SimFirstName} tries to calculate the new course in {M0.his}{F0.her} head, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} types in the new coordinates {M0.he}{F0.she} flies totally off-track. Now {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} got to work to bring the ship back into orbit before {M0.he}{F0.she} floats away!</Text>
  <Text Key="650F8B5C">Rules are there for a reason. Once {M0.he}{F0.she} gets approval to install the system, {M0.he}{F0.she} does. The pilots like it and everyone gives {0.SimFirstName} a polite round of applause. </Text>
  <Text Key="2F42F128">The gangster throws some epic parties and pays so well that {0.SimFirstName} can spend {M0.his}{F0.her} time counting money instead of thinking about ethics.</Text>
  <Text Key="C3371560">{0.SimFirstName} leaves the suspect handcuffed at a Space Gas station. When {M0.he}{F0.she} returns from stopping the hijacking, the suspect is still there, surly as ever. {0.SimFirstName} makes the collar on both cases.</Text>
  <Text Key="BD304AC1">The team never quite makes it to the right coordinates, so they see nothing, hear nothing, and discover nothing. They come home empty-handed and {0.SimFirstName}’s got to answer for it. </Text>
  <Text Key="D3974BC9">Between the Endangered Space Species Act and the Carnivorous Plant Weapons Treaty, {0.SimFirstName}’s got enough problems with government regulation. The upside just isn’t worth getting caught. {0.SimFirstName} coughs up the taxes.</Text>
  <Text Key="087481E1">While {0.SimFirstName}’s deputies are acting as glorified babysitters, smugglers and bandits have the solar system to themselves. You could steal Galactic Hall! The Star Council chides {0.SimFirstName} for leaving the galaxy understaffed.</Text>
  <Text Key="1CABAC7E">The task isn’t too difficult, but {0.SimFirstName}’s team executes flawlessly. The rest of the agency knows that they’re dependable in a pinch.</Text>
  <Text Key="9DC563D2">{0.SimFirstName} triangulates the origin of the transmission and follows it to the source…an alien ship! {0.SimFirstName} flies the flag of universal peace and makes the first recorded contact with a new race of alien beings. They are very proficient at math and love éclairs. </Text>
  <Text Key="BDD447B4">{0.SimFirstName} climbs into the pod and launches toward home. {M0.He}{F0.She} watches the ship retreat in {M0.his}{F0.her} rearview mirror, and sees the fire go out on its own. {M0.He}{F0.She} shouldn’t have bailed-now the mission’s a failure and {0.SimFirstName} has no way to recover the shuttle.</Text>
  <Text Key="038C19EB">Word spreads that {0.SimFirstName}'s prices are out of line and soon {M0.his}{F0.her}line of customers dries up. {M0.He}{F0.She}'s single-handedly deflated demand for the product. Soon {M0.he}{F0.she} has to drop {M0.his}{F0.her} prices to lower than market rate, just to get the skins off {M0.his}{F0.her} hands.</Text>
  <Text Key="F9E33E4B">The team delivers beautifully, and they gather tons of useful data for {0.SimFirstName}. They describe new plant and animal species, write down a new alien language, and discover potable water on an alien world.</Text>
  <Text Key="6AAE44CA">The crowds are so unruly and uncontrollable that the singer’s private security never could have handled it on their own. {0.SimFirstName}’s deputies help preserve order, and as a thank you, the singer makes a generous donation to {0.SimFirstName}’s department. </Text>
  <Text Key="241F9C83">Some space monsters just want to watch the galaxy burn. {0.SimFirstName} is fine stepping into some moral grey areas, but this gangster has no code of conduct at all! Even though it makes {M0.him}{F0.her} look weak, {0.SimFirstName} has to bail on the job.</Text>
  <Text Key="6117F72A">Nobody cares. Nobody cleans. Nobody changes a darn thing. Eventually, the galaxy is swimming in refuse and {0.SimFirstName}’s got to figure something else out. </Text>
  <Text Key="D4EAC535">There’s a reason the senior officer is the senior officer: to make these calls. Doesn’t {0.SimFirstName} trust him? He shoves {0.SimFirstName} off the driver’s seat and performs the fuel dump himself, and chews {0.SimFirstName} out the whole way to the space garage.</Text>
  <Text Key="52232B0A">People are so disgusted and outraged that a citizen’s commission forms in order to deal with the trash situation. They get paid by private donation, so the sheriff’s department saves money, too!</Text>
  <Text Key="1010AE08">No good deed goes unpunished - no sooner does {0.SimFirstName} sell out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mid-priced skins than a competitor enters the market, charging triple. He sells out and makes a fortune that could have been {0.SimFirstName}'s.</Text>
  <Text Key="586E9DEC">This reminds {0.SimFirstName} of that old video game about asteroids - it was called SPACE ROCK BLASTERS.  {M0.He}{F0.She} wends {M0.his}{F0.her} way through the asteroid field without getting even a scratch on the shuttle’s paint job.</Text>
  <Text Key="DB032908">None of the boys had any contraband. In fact, they were studying for a big exam. This is exactly why the Planet Patrol is not very popular in this sector. {0.SimFirstName} is going to deal with the fallout from this for a while...</Text>
  <Text Key="9D32240E">Turns out the astronauts took the shuttle on an unapproved joyride, and they all get fired. Although {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t like feeling like a snitch, {M0.his}{F0.her} boss takes note of {M0.his}{F0.her} attention to detail. Also, those astronauts were kind of jerks anyway.</Text>
  <Text Key="130E7F80">{M0.His}{F0.Her} grade isn’t great, but {0.SimFirstName} squeaks out a pass…just barely.</Text>
  <Text Key="4D8AACA8">There’s a minor altercation outside the venue where a fan gets a little handsy with the singer. She’s okay, but her handlers raise such a stink with the Star Council that {0.SimFirstName} gets blamed for it. </Text>
  <Text Key="68CF70C3">{M0.He}{F0.She} disengages the fuel lock and dumps thousands of gallons of propellant into space. Then the senior officer takes the stick and they head for the nearest space garage.</Text>
  <Text Key="8B3AF31F">With just a few keystrokes, {0.SimFirstName} calculates a new course and punches in the coordinates. {M0.He}{F0.She} flies well clear of the asteroids and even catches a nice glimpse of the Northern Lights. </Text>
  <Text Key="866FFF3F">A few miscreants protest, but soon the galactic citizens are shaping up. The cleanup campaign’s even got its own adorable advertising mascot: Smoot the Scolding Cephalopoid. </Text>
  <Text Key="81F73B1E">It takes much of {M0.his}{F0.her} potable water and {M0.his}{F0.her} best space pillow, but {0.SimFirstName} manages to smother the fire. Mission control praises {M0.him}{F0.her} for keeping {M0.his}{F0.her} cool, and rewards {M0.him}{F0.her} with the location of a secret stash of Astronaut Food Stix on board the ship. The mission continues.</Text>
  <Text Key="6D9A7F49">{M0.He}{F0.She} installs the system once it’s approved, but the pilots love it so much that they’re angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for not doing it sooner! Just can’t win for losing in this place. </Text>
  <Text Key="41276916">Customers respect that {0.SimFirstName} didn't cheat them. Even once the current craze for Snyxskin is over, they'll keep coming back to {0.SimFirstName} for all their exotic goods needs.</Text>
  <Text Key="E4696E43">It's not a popular move, but it's good business! {0.SimFirstName} makes a killing on the skins, which gives {M0.him}{F0.her} a little room to invest in some even more exotic inventory.</Text>
  <Text Key="0EF56610">Money is nice, but so is sleeping soundly at night. {0.SimFirstName} isn’t scared of getting {M0.his}{F0.her} hands a little dirty, but this space gangster is legitimately a maniac. It isn’t worth it. {0.SimFirstName} passes on the job.</Text>
  <Text Key="8D2E5796">{0.SimFirstName} leaves the suspect handcuffed at a Space Gas station, but when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets back from the hijacking scene all that’s left are the cuffs and the lingering smell of gas and failure. The guy’s long gone, and {0.SimFirstName} has lots of paperwork to do to explain why.</Text>
  <Text Key="69CD7943">{0.SimFirstName} straps {M0.himself}{F0.herself} into the pod and blasts off, headed straight for terra firma. As {M0.he}{F0.she} looks into the rearview mirror, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the ship explode! {M0.He}{F0.She} got out just in time. </Text>
  <Text Key="B2738DC3">“Stop asking so many questions,” says {0.SimFirstName}’s boss. Where the shuttle went and who was on it and what stars they may or may not have blown up are of no concern of {0.SimFirstName}’s.</Text>
  <Text Key="81495C25">Outside the venue, some fans get a little grabby with the singer, but that’s not {0.SimFirstName}’s problem.  A few citizens praise {M0.him}{F0.her} for refusing to subsidize celebrities with public resources.</Text>
  <Text Key="D16705E7">The senior officer gets furious when {0.SimFirstName} refuses to obey his command, but in a few seconds it’s clear that the situation is under control. It was just a light bulb out, not a fuel emergency. The senior officer praises {0.SimFirstName} for cool thinking in a crisis.</Text>
  <Text Key="DA14EF80">With a full night’s sleep, {0.SimFirstName} can employ expert-level test-taking strategies and do some critical thinking. {M0.He}{F0.She} manages to pass the test with a fairly decent grade, despite not actually knowing anything.</Text>
  <Text Key="084F6271">{0.SimFirstName} searches for the origin of the sound…and eventually discovers that it’s nothing but an old, busted radio in an abandoned spacecraft. {M0.He}{F0.She} wasted a ton of time and fuel for nothing. </Text>
  <Text Key="8492D166">Although {0.SimFirstName} tries to steer carefully, an asteroid crashes into the side of the ship. Not only is the paint job ruined, but there might be a huge hole, too. {M0.He}{F0.She} has to cut {M0.his}{F0.her} mission short and return to base early. </Text>
  <Text Key="DC443C71">{0.SimFirstName}’s paid to clean, not question authority. But after the second time the shuttle comes back with strange damage and markings, the bosses start to notice. Turns out the astronauts have been taking the shuttle on joyrides, and {0.SimFirstName} could have put a stop to it if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} spoken up earlier.</Text>
  <Text Key="CED453B2">{0.SimFirstName}’s team brings home some fine data points, but was the mission really worth the expense? The agency honchos are considering scrapping worthless little missions like this, which aren’t worth anyone’s time. </Text>
  <Text Key="7FD40601">{0.SimFirstName} goes to get little Ellie ready for bed. {M0.He}{F0.She} calls. No answer. Opens her door. Oh no. Red, blue and a mysterious brown over every wall. On her face, in her hair, flying from her fingers. {0.SimFirstName} begs her to stop but she just screams, “NO!!” {0.SimFirstName} isn’t supposed to give Time Outs, but {M0.he}{F0.she} has to do something…</Text>
  <Text Key="08EA6AF3">Painting the Walls</Text>
  <Text Key="7DB750D8">{0.SimFirstName} is babysitting for a new family, dolloping Quinoa and Kale Delight (“Charlie’s favorite!”) onto a dinner plate and sweetly ignoring the crashing sounds from the boy’s bedroom when suddenly it’s quiet. {M0.His}{F0.Her} heart skips. Then a small voice asks, “Can I have a cookie?” Charlie is not supposed to have ANY cookies until after dinner.</Text>
  <Text Key="EF59C5C6">Charlie's Dessert</Text>
  <Text Key="690BD91B">{0.SimFirstName} is happily watching some children play Family when {M0.he}{F0.she} hears screaming from inside the playhouse. Two girls have hold of the same baby doll and are tugging and screaming at each other. {0.SimFirstName} knows this is a “teaching moment”—the perfect opportunity for a lesson about sharing. So, how do you teach that again?</Text>
  <Text Key="8CB5EF49">Sharing Lessons</Text>

  <Text Key="AAC39F44">This is going pretty well! Now that {0.SimFirstName} has explained it, the girls have agreed that taking turns is fair. The only problem is who goes first. {0.SimFirstName} chooses the meaner girl. “That’s life,” mutters the meek one. So many lessons being learned!</Text>
  <Text Key="ED76A177">{0.SimFirstName} looks at the green glop on the boy’s plate and sighs. If anyone deserves a cookie, it’s Charlie. {M0.He}{F0.She} hands over the cookie, but Charlie has to PROMISE to eat a full meal afterward. Charlie nods, swallows the cookie, and hardly touches his dinner. But he goes to bed happy!</Text>
  <Text Key="B1B37659">{0.SimFirstName} takes the doll away and explains that neither girl gets it if they can’t share. Tears well in both girls’ eyes, and then one shoves the other. “See what you did? It was mine.” “No, mine.” “MINE.” {0.SimFirstName} quickly interrupts the shoving match with Music Time! Three verses into Old MacDonald, and all is happily forgotten. Nice!</Text>
  <Text Key="3309443D">Wow. Charlie has a serious set of lungs for a 4-year-old. {0.SimFirstName} practically has to force feed him the green glop, with the boy eyeing his cookie prize the entire time. Three tantrums, one dinner, and one cookie later, he finally goes to bed, grumbling about “the worst sitter in the world.”</Text>
  <Text Key="742572DC">Ellie is furious about the Time Out, but it works. After a few minutes of pouting, she helps {0.SimFirstName} wash off the walls. A hot bath and a few books later, she’s contentedly dreaming in her bed. Luckily, her parents are more embarrassed than angry, and very relieved that {0.SimFirstName}’s willing to come again.</Text>
  <Text Key="6C2AC22C">{0.SimFirstName} takes the doll away until the girls agree to share. One girl shoves the other. “See what you did? It was mine.” During the ensuing shoving match, the bigger girl yanks the doll back so hard its head pops off. “It’s dead!

  <Text Key="D836F8FA">{0.SimFirstName} explains that {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t like this game, and asks Ellie to tell {M0.him}{F0.her} when she’s done so they can clean up. {M0.He}{F0.She} steps outside. A second later, Ellie comes out, eyes down, lip out. They wash the walls. A hot bath and a few books later, she’s contentedly dreaming in her bed.</Text>
  <Text Key="CF73738A">{0.SimFirstName} takes a deep breath and tries reasoning with the child-turned-dervish. Ellie drops the paint, glares wickedly and starts throwing toys, stuffed animals, books.

  <Text Key="B1F1BFFD">{0.SimFirstName} is just about to hang up {M0.his}{F0.her} spiffy white apron when {M0.his}{F0.her} manager nods toward the sink.

  <Text Key="119B2DDB">Nothing ventured, nothing gained. {0.SimFirstName} brews up a fresh pot, labeling it “Midnight Magic” and slapping an Organic! sticker on the sign.

  <Text Key="4427C67A">Toward the end of a luxurious launch party, {0.SimFirstName} runs out of material. {M0.He}{F0.She} could easily repeat a few numbers without anyone taking notice, or use the opportunity to try out a classical world rock fusion ballad {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} been composing.</Text>
  <Text Key="45D63026">{0.SimFirstName} is asked to collaborate on the script for the Music Awards, to help the MC, but the final script doesn’t include any of {0.SimFirstName}’s jokes. {M0.He}{F0.She} could say nothing and settle for a nice check, or go to bat for a few of {M0.his}{F0.her} better gags.</Text>
  <Text Key="AC1746BB">Uh oh. {0.SimFirstName} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} is double-booked to play at a starlet’s private party and a charity event for third-world hunger. The good cause could give {M0.him}{F0.her} an out, but the starlet is known for her temper … and killer parties.</Text>

  <Text Key="ED7FFBBA">{0.SimFirstName}’s power-drill jingle is just about to air when {M0.he}{F0.she} notices a women’s deodorant commercial is using a very similar tune. What’s worse, {M0.he}{F0.she} can’t remember whether {M0.he}{F0.she} heard it before or after {M0.he}{F0.she} wrote {M0.his}{F0.her} jingle. {0.SimFirstName} can alert {M0.his}{F0.her} client, or hope that no one notices.</Text>
  <Text Key="50282390">It isn’t easy to find piano bars these days, but {0.SimFirstName} is lucky like that. {M0.His}{F0.Her} sad, sweet melodies have everyone feeling all right, until a former favorite comes back and reclaims the bench for himself. {0.SimFirstName} can play this two ways: offer to let him play a set, or tell him to move along.</Text>
  <Text Key="E9521039">{0.SimFirstName} knew it wasn’t a great idea to start {M0.his}{F0.her} comedy set so late. The crowd is getting rowdy, and {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} losing control fast. {M0.He}{F0.She} can either yell to get their attention or give up and shut it down.</Text>
  <Text Key="4DC50F7C">After a regular gig at a comedy club, {0.SimFirstName} notices {M0.his}{F0.her} paycheck is a little light. {M0.He}{F0.She} can go confront the owner right now, or hang tight until {M0.his}{F0.her} second set later on.</Text>

  <Text Key="53969724">{0.SimFirstName} hopes to make some extra cash on the side by teaching piano to neighborhood kids, but {M0.his}{F0.her} very first student spills soda all over the piano keys. {M0.He}{F0.She} can tell the little barbarian to come back next week, once it’s fixed, or charge the mother for cleaning and repair.</Text>

  <Text Key="CF7E42B2">{0.SimFirstName} should have known that the world wasn’t ready for a cocky cauliflower. {M0.He}{F0.She} is rapidly replaced by a tamer vegetable, who knows {M0.his}{F0.her} place in the food chain.</Text>
  <Text Key="11BF98CC">Luckily the piano is somewhat concealed by two stately ferns and an elegantly sweeping staircase. Despite difficulty breathing and a steady pain in {M0. his gut}{F0.her ribs} {0.SimFirstName} plays moderately well and goes utterly unnoticed.</Text>
  <Text Key="3C70F387">Everyone enjoyed {0.SimFirstName}’s set, but a couple of the judges are insisting that the gross-out act was the be-all and end-all of comedy. Ultimately they just flip a coin to determine the winner, but {0.SimFirstName} wins the toss!</Text>
  <Text Key="331B04FC">Whoops! The client notices the similarities between the jingles, and so does everyone else. {0.SimFirstName} tries to play it like a deliberate spoof, but that only makes things worse. Luckily, the deodorant company agrees to drop their lawsuit once {M0.his}{F0.her} jingle is pulled from the air.</Text>
  <Text Key="3A35B43B">Well played! After an hour of dabbing the keys with {M0.cotton boxer briefs}{F0.a jewelry cloth}, the piano sounds as good as new. It took a little work, but {0.SimFirstName} is able to avoid a costly repair.</Text>
  <Text Key="B96D6682">It works! A crowd starts to gather and clap to the music. One couple even attempts to dance to it. Of course, nobody knows who on earth {0.SimFirstName} is, but hey, they like {M0.his}{F0.her} music!</Text>
  <Text Key="BFE8E6F8">Oops! {0.SimFirstName} remembers the right line right after the wrong one trips out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. People are laughing-but at {M0.him}{F0.her}, not with {M0.him}{F0.her}.</Text>
  <Text Key="3B9E0375">Phew! Whatever was happening during rehearsal doesn’t repeat itself during the first performance. The master cellist has lost a little of his luster in {0.SimFirstName}’s eyes, but the concert goes fine.</Text>
  <Text Key="F9FE555C">The host is not happy, but the show must go on-and at least it won’t involve a wardrobe malfunction. The host has the caterers rearrange some large ferns, shielding {0.SimFirstName} from view. And recognition.</Text>
  <Text Key="C6FB0E1D">{0.SimFirstName} soon has everyone cracking up and the rough cut they put together looks great. The ad should be a hit. {0.SimFirstName} just hopes that when {M0.he}{F0.she} gets on stage now, people don’t shout, “Hey, it’s the cauliflower!”</Text>
  <Text Key="5070473C">Shouting throws {0.SimFirstName}’s rhythm off, and the librarian impressions fall a little flat. But {0.SimFirstName} gets warm applause for trying.</Text>
  <Text Key="B3468CE9">The producer is happy and {0.SimFirstName} gets a pretty decent check, for a vegetable. The ad is completely forgettable and gets pulled early.</Text>
  <Text Key="BED69AC6">Well, the good news is, {0.SimFirstName}'s friend is still speaking to {M0.him}{F0.her}. But no one in the audience cracked a smile, and everyone keeps asking, "Oh, was that you?" when {M0.he}{F0.she} asks them about the speech later.</Text>
  <Text Key="0726CDD5">There’s absolutely nothing wrong with the music {0.SimFirstName} has been playing, but now that {M0.he}{F0.she} has accepted the blame, it seems all wrong to the bride. {0.SimFirstName} is fired on the spot.</Text>
  <Text Key="3F0BCE1D">A famous celebrity in the crowd couldn’t help but voice their opinion of how terrible {0.SimFirstName}’s act is. Loudly. It isn’t long until everyone in the audience is murmuring.</Text>
  <Text Key="7C9111D7">The act just needed a little push! {0.SimFirstName} has really got everyone laughing now, and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend looks happy. At least someone at this party has personality!</Text>
  <Text Key="8D7ACC3C">Who knew {0.SimFirstName}’s friend could be so sensitive? He starts shouting insults back, airing a bit of {0.SimFirstName}’s dirty laundry. A few couples leave before the bouncer escorts the friend to the door.</Text>
  <Text Key="22FFDF22">Nice try. The host snatches the mic before {0.SimFirstName} can make a worse mess. {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation is going to take a pretty bad hit over this.</Text>
  <Text Key="603AA60C">{0.SimFirstName}’s friend hears what {M0.he}{F0.she} passed up to perform at the party, and is very grateful. He pumps everyone up and makes sure {0.SimFirstName} has a great crowd to perform to. It’s one of {M0.his}{F0.her} best shows!</Text>
  <Text Key="55B7C961">Nobody blames {0.SimFirstName}. In fact they all look a little relieved. {0.SimFirstName} helps {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to a plate of lukewarm food and calls it a day.</Text>
  <Text Key="E34CF048">Kudos to {0.SimFirstName}! {M0.His}{F0.Her} fingers fly up and down the frets, weaving a tune that blends seamlessly into the bassist’s wild solo. The crowd goes absolutely wild over the unexpected team-up. What a great show!</Text>
  <Text Key="3C59B9DD">Everyone is too Dazed and distracted to notice or care. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} could probably just play the same note continuously for 20 minutes and still go unremarked.</Text>
  <Text Key="08F7B670">When {0.SimFirstName} returns for {M0.his}{F0.her} second set, the club is closed and no one seems to know where the owner went. Doesn’t look like she plans to come back, either...</Text>
  <Text Key="C7F65E5E">The jingle is worse, but the VP is happy. Happy clients means more work for {0.SimFirstName}, and that’s more important than creative fulfillment, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="08F1616E">What was {0.SimFirstName} thinking? This is advertising, not the Music Awards. The VP throws a fit and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} rewrite it, using “piddle” in at least 4 places. And that’s just the 15-second cut!</Text>
  <Text Key="9798E218">{0.SimFirstName} matches the other comic in grossness, but unfortunately that means {M0.he}{F0.she} fails to stand out. The judges wind up flipping a coin and gives the win to {0.SimFirstName}!</Text>
  <Text Key="EB8D6094">Everyone is too Dazed and distracted to notice or care. In fact, {0.SimFirstName} could probably just play the same note continuously for 20 minutes and still go unremarked.</Text>
  <Text Key="1CCD1CA8">Well, it’s always nice to be nice. Who knows who’s watching? The prodigy thanks {0.SimFirstName} for the tip, but then promises to bury {M0.him}{F0.her} in the audition. Yikes!</Text>
  <Text Key="0BAEAD24">{0.SimFirstName}’s fans rally behind {M0.him}{F0.her}. One fan invites {0.SimFirstName} to play in his basement, and another promises a full-page article in a small zine. Too bad the buzz among club managers isn’t nearly as friendly.</Text>
  <Text Key="54438D5D">The director agrees and changes the script. {0.SimFirstName}’s jokes get the best laughs, and the MC brings in a few more for kicks. {0.SimFirstName} is only credited as “additional writers,” but hey, {M0.he}{F0.she} was on TV, sort of.</Text>
  <Text Key="E21EC419">Nice! {0.SimFirstName} gets him good! Who’s laughing now, Clownface?</Text>
  <Text Key="6A662D5F">Wow, what great friends {0.SimFirstName} has! EVERYONE was there. Too bad NO ONE laughed. But still, great friends!</Text>
  <Text Key="FEFEF2C8">{0.SimFirstName} nails it! Why, the gag is even funnier than it was before. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to write that one down before {M0.he}{F0.she} forgets it.</Text>
  <Text Key="EE0BD68A">This pack is a little too good at sniffing out the truth. As eyes start to narrow, {0.SimFirstName} starts to stutter and forgets the few ideas {M0.he}{F0.she} came up with on the way. {M0.He}{F0.She} cuts the intro short and gets on with the bidding. Hopefully {M0.his}{F0.her} employers won’t notice!</Text>
  <Text Key="70A027B7">Well, it turns out to be an okay party. After another round of polite conversation, someone turns on some music and things pick up. {0.SimFirstName}’s friend seems happy.</Text>
  <Text Key="04313E6C">The exec throws a temper tantrum, but no one seems to notice or care. They keep {0.SimFirstName}’s version and play it for the company at a team meeting. {M0.He}{F0.She} stills hears people humming it to themselves as {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves the building.</Text>
  <Text Key="3650F2AC">Bravo! This wins {0.SimFirstName} big points with the crowd at the bar, and the old pianist repays the favor by referring {M0.him}{F0.her} to a talent-agent connection of his. {0.SimFirstName} leaves with stars in {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes.</Text>
  <Text Key="B6ABBC86">Silence. {0.SimFirstName} flubbed it! One point, Funny Guy. Zero, {0.SimFirstName}. This is going to be a long night.</Text>
  <Text Key="B209776D">The director refuses. He loves the score as it is now, but he does promise to make sure the credit goes where it belongs: to {0.SimFirstName}’s colleague only.</Text>
  <Text Key="908CC312">Lucky for {0.SimFirstName}, the bride turns on the groom instead, who apparently was supposed to send the playlist. Whoops! The groom is awarded a slight reprieve as the photographer arrives to whisk the bride away. For the moment, all is well.</Text>
  <Text Key="FC85C95D">Wow! {0.SimFirstName} has never had such an enthusiastic crowd. Turns out this assembly of family and friends has a wicked sense of humor! {0.SimFirstName}’s friend is furious to be humiliated at his own wedding, but {0.SimFirstName} has some great new material to play with now.</Text>
  <Text Key="A3A37747">YES! Everyone enjoys {0.SimFirstName}’s well-crafted set, but the gross-out act was very polarizing. That means {0.SimFirstName} gets the win easily.</Text>
  <Text Key="03E2C0D0">A check is a check. {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t get to hear {M0.his}{F0.her} material on TV, but when the MC’s performance falls flat, {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t take the hit for it, either.</Text>
  <Text Key="F3A440DC">The crowd boos and starts throwing things at the stage. Bombarded by lipsticks and lighters, {0.SimFirstName} beats a hasty retreat backstage, where {M0.he}{F0.she} is promptly fired by the headliner’s manager.</Text>
  <Text Key="A3C28583">The bassist is too dazed to notice. {0.SimFirstName} capitalizes on the crowd’s attention by pounding out an epic ballad of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, winning some new fans.</Text>
  <Text Key="1CBC61E8">A stringy kid and his mom ask {0.SimFirstName} if {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} ever considered playing birthday parties. Time to find a backup band!</Text>
  <Text Key="3B781515">Nothing’s worse than a sore loser. The least {0.SimFirstName} could have done is make the accusation funny. The crowd turns hostile, and no amount of “what’s up with so-and-so” jokes can bring them back around.</Text>
  <Text Key="29B20EA9">Luckily, the cellist thanks {0.SimFirstName}. He’s had a bit of a head cold and was losing focus. They practice the piece again and this time everything sounds beautiful.</Text>
  <Text Key="8B5C0561">Well, the payday will be nice, but the corporate crowd could not be less interested in {0.SimFirstName}’s act. Worse, {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is absolutely livid that {0.SimFirstName} backed out of his party at the last second.</Text>
  <Text Key="4C86E91C">{0.SimFirstName} just learned one of the most important lessons of live performance. Yelling at angry people just makes them angrier. Where is that back door again?</Text>
  <Text Key="8E6CA8D0">Nice try. The child throws a wild temper tantrum and the mother shoos the kid’s outside, but not before staring daggers at {0.SimFirstName}. Hey, it’s the kid’s party. He can cry if he wants to.</Text>
  <Text Key="0BEA5F51">Nothing’s funnier than a roast, when it’s done right. {0.SimFirstName} turns the hack into a real laughing stock and wins the competition.</Text>
  <Text Key="64C1BB52">The prodigy’s audition is quite impressive, but his disheveled appearance is deemed unsuitable and {0.SimFirstName} wins the spot.</Text>
  <Text Key="9F18706C">Practice makes perfect. And judging by the audience response, {0.SimFirstName} is closer to practice than perfect. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should have played something a little darker? Suffering goes well with coffee.</Text>
  <Text Key="2AA3D625">Somebody else alerts the prodigy, and he finds a new shirt in time. His audition is mind-blowing, while {0.SimFirstName}’s is quickly forgotten.</Text>
  <Text Key="88F88D8E">It seems like everyone is humming {0.SimFirstName}’s tune! Or maybe, it’s the other one…but {0.SimFirstName} likes to believe it’s {M0.his}{F0.hers}. Not many people are buying drills, but the client chalks that up to a glitch in the rotor.</Text>
  <Text Key="BAA289F4">The owner apologizes for the mistake and sheepishly writes {0.SimFirstName} a new check. {0.SimFirstName} uses {M0.his}{F0.her} comic skills to help her laugh it off.</Text>
  <Text Key="2D12C5E5">This tack seems to calm the bride for now. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} has been cultivating {M0.his}{F0.her} repertoire. {M0.He}{F0.She} has just enough acceptable material to fill the hour before the bride turns her daggers on the arriving band.</Text>
  <Text Key="0DEAECAB">{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t make much of a mark on this movie, but it’s always neat to see your name in the credits!</Text>
  <Text Key="0171F0B1">Phew! It worked. {0.SimFirstName} gets a big laugh and has won over the crowd. It’s smooth sailing from here.</Text>
  <Text Key="BD9436A9">{0.SimFirstName} walks out, but the fans don’t follow. After all, they kinda like this club. Where’s all that {M0.fangirl}{F0.fanboy} outrage when {M0.he}{F0.she} really needs it?!</Text>
  <Text Key="9974E959">Well, that didn’t go well. Instead of praising {0.SimFirstName} for caring enough to call, he berates {M0.him}{F0.her} for being a fake and pulls the ad. The silver lining? The client keeps quiet to protect his own rep, which protects {0.SimFirstName}’s as well.</Text>
  <Text Key="B7ECA9A2">Perseverance pays off! Suddenly the section clicks. There’s no stopping {0.SimFirstName} now!</Text>
  <Text Key="5B64223D">Sometimes the best thing is to have a little laugh at your own expense. {0.SimFirstName} admits to forgetting and moves on to something {M0.he}{F0.she} does remember, saving {M0.his}{F0.her} act and rep.</Text>
  <Text Key="138C905F">Whew! That did it. The crowd snaps to attention and even laughs, inspiring {0.SimFirstName} to deliver one of {M0.his}{F0.her} best performances yet.</Text>
  <Text Key="7FFF7D33">The great thing about launch parties is that companies go all out. After a long night of great food and great music, no one remembers {0.SimFirstName} at all, except the host, who is perfectly happy to sweep the whole thing under the rug.</Text>
  <Text Key="7138A24F">Well, that is nice of {0.SimFirstName}. Too bad the old-timer forgets to give the piano bench back, not to mention the bread in the jar. Maybe there’s another piano bar somewhere?</Text>
  <Text Key="76056960">The owner stares and shrugs. “Times are tough,” is all {0.SimFirstName} can get from her. Until she cancels {0.SimFirstName}’s next show, anyway.</Text>
  <Text Key="ED563CBE">This is embarrassing. {0.SimFirstName} {M0.splits his pants}{F0. snaps her shoulder strap} the instant {M0.he}{F0.she} sits down at the piano bench, which is made worse by the fact the piano is center stage. The crowd politely pretends not to notice, but {M0.he}{F0.she} will still have to pay a tailor to fix the borrowed {M0.tux}{F0.gown}.</Text>
  <Text Key="9640F613">Well, the club was empty, but {0.SimFirstName} got in a great practice run and killed the butterflies in {M0.his}{F0.her} stomach. Of course with no one in the audience it’s hard to know which jokes would have gotten laughs…</Text>
  <Text Key="1F676421">Best to play it safe. {0.SimFirstName}’s routine goes fine without the joke, and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is none the wiser. Besides, there’s always tomorrow.</Text>
  <Text Key="80F197EF">Without a target to mock, the crowd settles down and {0.SimFirstName} gets to leave in one piece. Too bad {M0.his}{F0.her} rep takes the hit for the incomplete set.</Text>
  <Text Key="610606A7">So it turns out {0.SimFirstName} does not remember how to juggle. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should stick to more mature crowds. At least there’s fewer spitballs.</Text>
  <Text Key="98368823">The starlet berates {0.SimFirstName} for ditching the charity, and frets that the choice will taint her impeccable reputation. The tip money {0.SimFirstName} hoped for goes to the starlet’s publicist to clean up the mess.</Text>
  <Text Key="43B104BD">How dare {0.SimFirstName} insult the dignity of animals by laughing at their expense! The crowd is generous with their disapproval and stingy with their donations. {0.SimFirstName} donates part of {M0.his}{F0.her} pay to make up for it.</Text>
  <Text Key="72451561">The problem with covers is that someone has always played them a little better. You know, like the rock legends who created them. {0.SimFirstName} gets polite applause, and is promptly forgotten.</Text>
  <Text Key="EE4FD91F">{0.SimFirstName}’s new jokes work! Most of the time that is. And the adrenaline of taking a risk makes {M0.him}{F0.her} come off as fresh and confident, which everyone loves. {0.SimFirstName} wins!</Text>

  <Text Key="AB5038CF">It should be written somewhere: never side with the establishment against your own fans. {0.SimFirstName}’s fans storm out and smash {M0.his}{F0.her} reputation on every message board and social site they can think of. Why do fans get so angry??</Text>
  <Text Key="E9C8658D">The crowd is insulted. A lady in a purple pants suit yells, “We’re not all deaf!” She gets more laughs than {0.SimFirstName} does.</Text>
  <Text Key="0E9C91A7">That won’t be the only postponed lesson. After an hour of dabbing at the keys with a dish cloth, {0.SimFirstName} is forced to admit that the piano needs to be professionally serviced. The instrument will be unplayable for a while.</Text>
  <Text Key="1CA93C5F">Bravo! {0.SimFirstName} receives a huge tip and is even hazily visible in an industry magazine photo!</Text>
  <Text Key="57B13CB5">Good call. After {0.SimFirstName} gets a drink, {M0.he}{F0.she} feels much better and the notes just seem to fall into place. There’s no stopping {0.SimFirstName} now!</Text>
  <Text Key="E51FDDB7">The child squeals with delight and throws {0.SimFirstName} every ball he can find. It goes well until the kid tosses in a muddy kickball, which lands on his mom’s white sofa. Trying to recover it, {0.SimFirstName} lets the other balls fall. The kids crack up. Mom doesn’t.</Text>
  <Text Key="3822748F">It might not be the most glamorous gig, but {0.SimFirstName} feels that {M0.he}{F0.she} made the right choice. Sims enjoy the music and a decent amount of money is raised for a good cause.</Text>
  <Text Key="89954E6E">At first {0.SimFirstName} thinks the cellist hasn’t heard {M0.him}{F0.her}. But when {M0.he}{F0.she} tries again, it’s clear {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} getting brushed off. {M0.He}{F0.She} wonders if {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} wind up being blamed for the discordant tones once they perform.</Text>
  <Text Key="CAF3344F">Not only is {0.SimFirstName} twice as frustrated, the cellist in the practice room next door is frustrated too. It would be easier to get it right without all that pounding on the wall.</Text>
  <Text Key="DBDBF7B3">The director refuses. He loves the script how it is, and he makes sure his colleagues know where the credit belongs: with the other comedians.</Text>
  <Text Key="FB6CB75D">Later, {0.SimFirstName} sees one of the other composers giving an interview where he claims full credit for the final score. Is anyone even going to believe that {0.SimFirstName} helped once the interview is published?</Text>
  <Text Key="D2B8EC64">{0.SimFirstName}’s friend loves the dig! He is so thrilled to be part of the routine that he buys {0.SimFirstName} a drink to celebrate.</Text>

  <Text Key="33547A40">{0.SimFirstName} creates a scene fending off the old piano player. The crowd is not happy. They come to listen to old standards and forget about life for a while, not watch ugly confrontations between selfish pianists! The bar owner intercedes and gives the set to the other player.</Text>
  <Text Key="2B2F868E">Perhaps {0.SimFirstName} should have trusted {M0.his}{F0.her} instincts. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets crickets for {M0.his}{F0.her} disgusting humor. Why’d they laugh for the other comic? It seems gross only stays fresh so long...</Text>
  <Text Key="81160881">Unfortunately nobody shows up, for {0.SimFirstName} or the other “comic”. {0.SimFirstName} is sure {M0.he}{F0.she} was the funniest {M0.guy}{F0.gal} in the house, and now, no one can argue.</Text>
  <Text Key="958A65AB">What a howl! There’s nothing animal lovers love more than a few good animal jokes! The crowd goes wild and donates generously. Now these animals should have a better quality of life than {0.SimFirstName} does!</Text>

  <Text Key="3561E679">{0.SimFirstName} is on a roll! This joint is so clean, {M0.he}{F0.she} can see {M0.his}{F0.her} face gleaming back from the tabletops! But then {M0.he}{F0.she} notices some kind of pinkish glop jiggling from the seat of a chair. {M0.He}{F0.She} could just wipe it—and throw out {M0.his}{F0.her} rag—but then again {M0.his}{F0.her} job title does say “table...”</Text>
  <Text Key="426D6BA1">When {0.SimFirstName} takes over the register, the line is already out the door. But it seems the customer at the counter hasn’t noticed:  the woman squints at the menu, grimaces, thinks. The line’s getting longer—and grumpier. Should {0.SimFirstName} ask her to step aside to decide on her order, or wait for her to make up her mind?</Text>
  <Text Key="B254366F">Ask to Step Aside</Text>
  <Text Key="A32A6956">Wait for Her Order</Text>
  <Text Key="1E4E9407">Nice work! When {0.SimFirstName} points out the line behind her, the woman agrees to let someone else go first. Even better, {0.SimFirstName}’s new manager is watching and praises {M0.his}{F0.her} “proactive thinking.” Score!</Text>
  <Text Key="9B59F7D3">Luckily, it’s just about time for {0.SimFirstName}’s break. By the time {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} back, the mystery glop is gone, though where it went {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t know.</Text>
  <Text Key="E9E1F23F">Luckily, it’s just about time for {0.SimFirstName}’s break. Unluckily, a shriek interrupts {M0.his}{F0.her}  departure. A cheerleader just sat down in the mess, and she is not happy about it at all. {0.SimFirstName}’s manager calls {M0.him}{F0.her} out to wipe down all the chairs while the entire restaurant watches.</Text>
  <Text Key="48CF3F95">The manager isn’t thrilled about the extra time or wasted meat, but {0.SimFirstName} sure feels better doing the right thing. Not that {M0.he’d}{F0.she’d} ever eat here, knowing what {M0.he}{F0.she} knows, but it gives {M0.him}{F0.her} hope someone might do the same for {M0.him}{F0.her} someday.</Text>
  <Text Key="E13BBB9F">Five second rule, right? {0.SimFirstName} slaps on some cheese and extra sauce and moves on to the next order. When no complaints come back, {M0.he}{F0.she} sighs in relief, trying not to notice the grime on the floor.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0C552E6">No one can actually take forever, even if it feels like it sometimes. {0.SimFirstName}’s smile is frozen to {M0.his}{F0.her} face, but eventually {M0.he}{F0.she} gets the woman’s order and turns to the next person in line. So much for fast food. But fortunately no one seems too surprised.</Text>
  <Text Key="19791F07">Five second rule, right? {0.SimFirstName} slaps on some cheese and extra sauce and moves on to the next order. Unfortunately, this order was for one of those “check the burger and notice hair and used chewing gum stuck to it” customers. The customer yells at the manager, who in turn yells at {0.SimFirstName}.</Text>
  <Text Key="81C2D762">Well, that backfired. Instead of graciously stepping aside, the customer is furious and takes even more time complaining about the “lack of respect” and “pitiful service” and “problems with today’s youth.” Her yammering brings out {0.SimFirstName}’s new manager, who ends up comping her order.</Text>
  <Text Key="74E9081A">Yuck! Disgusting. The mystery glop is chunkier than it first looked and REEKS of re-processed onion.  {0.SimFirstName} drops {M0.his}{F0.her} rag in the trash and scrubs {M0.his}{F0.her} hands raw, but the stink sticks for what seems like hours.</Text>

  <Text Key="45445FBD">{0.SimFirstName} isn’t afraid of what other kids think. {M0.He}{F0.She} and {M0.what’s-his-name}{F0.what’s-her-name} have a lot of fun. {M0.He}{F0.She} even offers to help {0.SimFirstName} with homework during free time!</Text>
  <Text Key="C3A47623">{0.SimFirstName} tries to make a joke out of it—something about alphabets and there’s nothing before the A—but when every kid stays silent, {M0.he}{F0.she} opts for silence, too. One question down, only 22 to go…This is going to be {M0.his}{F0.her} longest class ever.</Text>
  <Text Key="383622E4">{0.SimFirstName}’s finely honed intelligence isn’t just good for tests. It’s great for outsmarting adults! Sniffling and quivering, {M0.he}{F0.she} shuffles to the front and asks to go see the school nurse. Yes! No test today…just a nice soft cot and the sweet smell of adhesive bandages.</Text>
  <Text Key="58409E57">{0.SimFirstName} dusts off the cookie and places it back in the open bag, but not without checking who owns it. {M0.He}{F0.She} is happy about doing the right thing, but the kid should also know they owe {M0.him}{F0.her} one.</Text>
  <Text Key="50336A7A">{0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he}{F0.she} can do this on {M0.his}{F0.her} own. {M0.He}{F0.She} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes, blocks out the notebook, and guesses each letter slowly. Incorrect! The brainiac falls off her chair laughing. Still, better to lose honestly, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="7078852E">No one ever looks closely at these things, right? {0.SimFirstName} signs it quickly under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and passes it in with a smile. Unfortunately, {M0.he}{F0.she} forgets to sign {M0.his}{F0.her} parent’s name instead of {M0.his}{F0.her} own, and spends the day in the principal’s office instead.</Text>
  <Text Key="97DB4915">When {0.SimFirstName} is done with {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch, {M0.he}{F0.she} ties a {M0.sweatshirt}{F0.sweater} around {M0.his}{F0.her} waist and goes off to play. {M0.His}{F0.Her} bottom feels clammy and gross, but it’ll dry soon…{M0.he}{F0.she} hopes.</Text>
  <Text Key="B3A25518">Yep, Ballistic Watermelon—yum! {0.SimFirstName} is chewing happily when {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher stops and asks what’s in {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. {0.SimFirstName} isn’t sure which will be worse—cleaning desks at recess or the tummy-ache that’s coming on.</Text>
  <Text Key="B118B7EE">{0.SimFirstName} manages to unzip {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack just enough to get a good look at the words. {M0.He}{F0.She}’s almost done with the quiz when Smarty Marty sees and tattles on {M0.him}{F0.her}. Off {0.SimFirstName} goes to the principal, with another big fat F!</Text>
  <Text Key="1AD680A9">{0.SimFirstName} keeps {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes trained dutifully on the board, hoping the kid will stop. Instead, the kid fires a ball of paper so hard it rolls up to the teacher’s feet. For once, somebody else gets in trouble, and {0.SimFirstName} gets to look innocent and studious!</Text>
  <Text Key="FECF5E6D">{0.SimFirstName} walks over and taps the girl on the shoulder, then whispers into her ear. Blushing, the girl mumbles something and runs off to the girls’ room, one of her friends following. </Text>
  <Text Key="43FA9E39">OK, maybe {0.SimFirstName} should have snuck something quieter. {M0.He}{F0.She} only has the wrapper halfway open when the teacher takes {M0.his}{F0.her} SugarBops and sends {M0.him}{F0.her} to the principal, grumbly stomach and all.</Text>
  <Text Key="8E7C0B88">The new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} is alone, since {M0.she}{F0.he} doesn’t have many friends yet. But when {0.SimFirstName} presents the note, the new {M0.girl}{F0.boy} misunderstands. “Umm…I don’t even know you.” Worse, the class gossip comes around the corner and spies them together. However bad this feels now, it’ll be much worse soon…</Text>
  <Text Key="C664B885">{0.SimFirstName} is just shoving the cookie into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth when a loudmouth kid accuses {M0.him}{F0.her} of sneaking food. {0.SimFirstName}’s mouth is way too full to answer. Luckily, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s only in mild trouble, but sooner or later someone will look for that cookie...</Text>
  <Text Key="82E852E7">{0.SimFirstName} isn’t afraid of what other kids think. {M0.He}{F0.She} and {M0.what’s-his-name}{F0. what’s-her-name} have a lot of fun, at least until the {M0.boy}{F0.girl} calls {M0.him}{F0.her} Stupid. Hey, no fair! Nerds aren’t supposed to be bullies!</Text>
  <Text Key="6EFD0402">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher commends {M0.him}{F0.her} for {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty and marks an F next to {M0.his}{F0.her} name. “Next time, you won’t forget,” she smiles. </Text>
  <Text Key="6DFC4B1A">{0.SimFirstName} knows better than to chew someone else’s gum, especially with all the flu bugs going around. {M0.He}{F0.She} gives it to a classmate instead, who is super happy to have it.</Text>
  <Text Key="5B21380A">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher commends {M0.him}{F0.her} for {M0.his}{F0.her} honesty and gives {M0.him}{F0.her} a one-time extension. {M0.He}{F0.She} has a lot to get done in a short time, but at least {M0.he}{F0.she} got a second chance!</Text>
  <Text Key="F08219D0">Smart move. {0.SimFirstName} knows not to trust hyper-competitive smart kids. {M0.He}{F0.She} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes, blocks out the notebook, and guesses each letter slowly. Correct! {0.SimFirstName} is the surprise winner! </Text>
  <Text Key="B29B0F79">Caught with marker still on his hands, {0.SimFirstName}’s harasser is sent to the principal and worse, home to his furious mom. Unfortunately, being a tattletale is not exactly a boost to {0.SimFirstName}’s reputation. And grade schoolers have looooong memories...</Text>
  <Text Key="C3EF3543">{0.SimFirstName} thinks hard—where would {M0.he}{F0.she} go if {M0.he}{F0.she} were a tiny, fluffy critter often surrounded by screaming children? Sure enough, Fluffy has squeezed himself behind the spooky science jars, hoping the floating specimens will scare off pursuers. Nice try, Fluffy! Never underestimate {0.SimFirstName} when trouble is on the line.</Text>
  <Text Key="C9E8950E">{0.SimFirstName} waits until the cafeteria monitor is near, then shouts for the mean kid to unhand {M0.his}{F0.her} food. The monitor quickly walks over and simply shushes {0.SimFirstName} AND the mean kid. Is this justice?? It’s almost like the cafeteria monitor doesn’t take her job seriously!</Text>
  <Text Key="D4A9CD7D">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is busy writing on the board. Shuffling the top paper under {M0.his}{F0.her} shirt, {0.SimFirstName} excuses {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to the bathroom. A few minutes and several word changes later, {M0.he}{F0.she}’s got a pretty convincing copy in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack. Nice!</Text>
  <Text Key="7A33091A">No one ever looks closely at these things, and no one can read {0.SimFirstName}’s mom’s writing anyways. {M0.He}{F0.She} signs it quickly under {M0.his}{F0.her} desk and passes it in with a smile.</Text>
  <Text Key="7B770A3F">Even if the girl IS trying to copy, she’ll never admit it. When {0.SimFirstName} accuses her of cheating, those sweet, innocent eyes fill with tears and now everyone thinks {0.SimFirstName} is mean. Rats!</Text>
  <Text Key="0BAC75AA">{0.SimFirstName} shrugs. Squirms. Then tells the truth. “I’m smart?” {M0.He}{F0.She} wasn’t trying to be funny, but the laughter feels friendly enough. One question down, 22 more to go! {0.SimFirstName} has definitely got this.</Text>
  <Text Key="41710224">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is very pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} extra effort. Of course, {0.SimFirstName} could have spent the time checking {M0.his}{F0.her} work for spelling errors, but baby steps are fine for now. {0.SimFirstName} gets a gold star!</Text>
  <Text Key="630EFE58">To take {M0.his}{F0.her} mind off lunch, {0.SimFirstName} actually pays attention to the lesson. Wow, how cool—{0.SimFirstName} is really and truly learning something today!</Text>
  <Text Key="B87C2BB1">The girl seems happy enough and {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t really know her. Unfortunately, some older kids notice, too, and they start pointing and laughing loudly. The girl cries. {0.SimFirstName} can’t help but feel that all of this could have been avoided.</Text>
  <Text Key="AD4CDCDB">Well, that didn’t go well. {0.SimFirstName} only got a shrug for an answer, and now {M0.his}{F0.her} friend is actively avoiding {M0.him}{F0.her}. Oh well, who needs a friend like that anyway? *sigh*</Text>
  <Text Key="B69F6D09">Well, this time at least, being honest doesn’t pay. {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher makes {M0.him}{F0.her} help out the nurse while {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates go on the trip.</Text>
  <Text Key="4E4F1F9F">{0.SimFirstName} places {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe over the bib and grabs it when {M0.he}{F0.she} thinks no one is looking. Unfortunately, the class bully IS looking and immediately starts calling {M0.him}{F0.her} a little baby. Little help here, new kid? No??</Text>
  <Text Key="89F2836D">Lunch is almost over when the class bully notices the bib on the floor. He can’t wait to find the “little baby” who dropped it, but the new kid says nothing and neither does {0.SimFirstName}, who may have just made a new friend.</Text>
  <Text Key="C4CF0886">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is very pleased with {M0.his}{F0.her} focus and effort. After all, {M0.he}{F0.she} rarely finishes {M0.his}{F0.her} assignments at all, so why would the teacher expect pictures? {0.SimFirstName} even gets the coveted gold star!</Text>
  <Text Key="C2D392B3">Up to the front {0.SimFirstName} goes, where the teacher hands {M0.him}{F0.her} some cymbals. Crash-bang! {M0.He}{F0.She} makes so much noise {M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t even notice the teacher’s cries for {M0.him}{F0.her} to stop—not until the principal snatches the cymbals away. Oops.</Text>
  <Text Key="F26F20D2">{0.SimFirstName} runs into the hall, shouting, “Fluffy is loose! Fluffy is loose!” Soon the lab is packed with kids on a rescue mission, and the gerbil is recovered in no time. With all the commotion, no one thinks to ask how he escaped, and {0.SimFirstName} decides it can stay between {M0.him}{F0.her} and Fluffy, this time.</Text>
  <Text Key="C1C85C94">{0.SimFirstName} jumps off the bench, shouting, “Gross! What WAS that?” {M0.His}{F0.Her} friends laugh, but “with” {M0.him}{F0.her} more than “at” {M0.him}{F0.her}. Phew!</Text>
  <Text Key="5F945758">{0.SimFirstName} glances around and decides it’s too risky. But imagining that cool shade helps {M0.him}{F0.her} pick up a little speed! {0.SimFirstName} finishes all {M0.his}{F0.her} laps with a new personal best time!</Text>
  <Text Key="90E274ED">Yes! {0.SimFirstName}’s plane does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing on the substitute’s desk. Amazingly, the sub still doesn’t see it, but {0.SimFirstName} scores points with {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, who do.</Text>
  <Text Key="19DCE7A3">Phew! {0.SimFirstName} tells the teacher what happened, and the teacher helps {M0.him}{F0.her} transfer {M0.his}{F0.her} answers onto a new form. Just enough time to finish the rest of the test!</Text>
  <Text Key="C60B93E8">{0.SimFirstName} hides the plane in {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack until recess. By the time {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to the playground, the nose is bent and the thing won’t fly straight. Back to the drawing board…</Text>
  <Text Key="7409A685">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is busy writing on the board. Shuffling the top paper under {M0.his}{F0.her} shirt, {0.SimFirstName} excuses {M0.himself}{F0.herself} to the bathroom. Unfortunately, {0.SimFirstName} is followed by the owner of the paper, who takes {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch in exchange for silence.</Text>
  <Text Key="438CF883">{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t think {M0.his}{F0.her} answer is all that funny, but for some reason, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are falling off their seats laughing. Wow! Great crowd! {0.SimFirstName} has definitely got this.</Text>
  <Text Key="3C9A6690">The mean kid swipes {0.SimFirstName}’s brownie, just as expected. But what the bully WON’T be expecting is a brownie full of laxatives! Unfortunately, before {0.SimFirstName} can enjoy a self-satisfied chuckle, {M0.he}{F0.she} sees the mean kid offer the brownie to the principal in an effort to suck up! Oh no!!</Text>
  <Text Key="979E0330">Oops. Turns out the party wasn’t even for {0.SimFirstName}’s friend—it was only a show on TV! {0.SimFirstName} feels a little silly, but very glad {M0.he}{F0.she} asked.</Text>
  <Text Key="1F83F4E0">{0.SimFirstName} decides to wait it out and see if anyone comes forward. Sure enough at lunch some friends laugh and wave to {M0.him}{F0.her}. “Hey, Cutie!” one taunts. {0.SimFirstName} wads up the note and tosses it at them, laughing along with the joke. Someday it’ll happen for real, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} relieved it’s not today.</Text>
  <Text Key="DDF6FBB7">This is {0.SimFirstName}’s chance to show off {M0.his}{F0.her} talents! Up to the front {M0.he}{F0.she} goes, where the teacher hands {M0.him}{F0.her} some cymbals. Crash-bang! This is one performance no one will forget, not for a long time.</Text>
  <Text Key="910FAB8C">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher is not pleased at all with {M0.his}{F0.her} timely achievement. Frowning, she picks up the paper, circles 5 spelling errors and insists that {M0.he}{F0.she} use the remaining time to do it all over again.</Text>
  <Text Key="E4847B87">{0.SimFirstName} slides quickly under the bleachers, wedging {M0.himself}{F0.herself} into a nice shady spot. Unfortunately, lying down in the shade is a little too restful. When {0.SimFirstName} awakes, Coach is glaring down at {M0.him}{F0.her}. Now everyone has to watch {0.SimFirstName} finish {M0.his}{F0.her} laps!</Text>
  <Text Key="9DC8F2C3">Yep, Ballistic Watermelon—yum! {0.SimFirstName} chews happily through the rest of the class, feeling pleased if a little queasy.</Text>
  <Text Key="E5286542">{0.SimFirstName} stashes {M0.his}{F0.her} poster in the hall. Later, at recess, {M0.he}{F0.she} goes to recover it and cover it with silvery marker swirls, only to find it gone! Someone threw it out! Now {0.SimFirstName} will have to start all over AND take a late grade!</Text>
  <Text Key="A998CE2C">{0.SimFirstName} sits back while the other kid takes the stage. The kid looks pretty embarrassed as he’s asked to “improvise” something on bongos. But before {0.SimFirstName} can laugh, the music teacher calls {M0.him}{F0.her} up to play back-up on rainstick. That’s not even a real instrument!</Text>
  <Text Key="C457FD11">{0.SimFirstName} tries to quell {M0.his}{F0.her} anxiety by taking big, deep breaths, and what do you know, it works! Sure, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates shoot {M0.him}{F0.her} some funny looks, but when you’re an A student you have to take every test seriously!</Text>
  <Text Key="1A10756B">Phew! {0.SimFirstName} manages to unzip {M0.his}{F0.her} backpack just enough to get a good look at the words. {M0.He}{F0.She} doesn’t get all the words right, since they are still covered in doodles, but then getting a perfect score would make {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher suspicious.</Text>
  <Text Key="18BCA6A2">{0.SimFirstName} nudges {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor with an elbow, and the kid makes his way to the stage. The poor kid is given cymbals and asked to “improvise.” What follows is a noisy, embarrassing mess that will stay with the boy for years. Yikes!</Text>
  <Text Key="26F01F2C">Sometimes adults are smarter than they look. {0.SimFirstName} shuffles to the front and asks to go see the school nurse. The teacher says {M0.he}{F0.she} can go...right after the test!</Text>
  <Text Key="9820E28D">Pretending to concentrate, {0.SimFirstName} closes {M0.his}{F0.her} eyes and recites the letters the girl showed him. “Incorrect,” snaps the proctor. {0.SimFirstName} loses! The brainiac falls off her chair laughing, along with half the room. It was a mean trick!</Text>
  <Text Key="124CF725">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher sees {M0.him}{F0.her} doodling and comes over to check {M0.his}{F0.her} work. Frowning, she picks up the paper, circles 5 spelling errors and insists that {0.SimFirstName} use the remaining time to do it all over again.</Text>
  <Text Key="2ABE4FE6">{0.SimFirstName} thinks hard—where would {M0.he}{F0.she} go if {M0.he}{F0.she} were a tiny, fluffy critter often surrounded by screaming children? Up on the shelves? Behind the toilet? Inside Mr. Bones? By the time the teacher comes in, the lab is a mess and Fluffy’s still missing.</Text>
  <Text Key="AC693338">{0.SimFirstName} decides to take pride in {M0.his}{F0.her} work and not risk getting a late mark. Brandishing {M0.his}{F0.her} poster, {M0.he}{F0.she} turns it in, earning a flaccid smile from the teacher and a bright red B.</Text>
  <Text Key="47914259">{0.SimFirstName} tries to shuffle over to the hooks where {M0.he}{F0.she} keeps a {M0. sweatshirt}{F0. sweater}, but before {M0.he}{F0.she} can tie it around {M0.his}{F0.her} waist, an older kid shouts, “EWW! That kid wet {M0.his}{F0.her} pants!” Everyone stares. {0.SimFirstName} borrows pants from Lost &amp; Found to wear for the rest of the day.</Text>
  <Text Key="4E0CFA18">Who needs a friend like that anyway? {0.SimFirstName} tunes it out and plays with the new {M0.boy}{F0.girl} at recess. Later, {M0.he}{F0.she} finds the invite in {M0.his}{F0.her} cubby, buried under a stale bag of pretzels. Oops!</Text>
  <Text Key="991AC50A">{0.SimFirstName} stuffs the cookie into {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth, hurriedly brushing away crumbs. Chocolate chip—awesome! {M0.He}{F0.She} is so energetic in class afterwards that {M0.he}{F0.she} even earns a star for enthusiasm.</Text>
  <Text Key="82FD463D">{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t get all the words right, but {M0.he}{F0.she} does get a few letters right in each word! Besides, {M0.he}{F0.she} gave it {M0.his}{F0.her} best effort, and that’s what counts the most, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="0BF33877">Phew! {0.SimFirstName} feels so much better with a few SugarBops in {M0.his}{F0.her} tummy, and the teacher didn’t even notice. {M0.He}{F0.She} even snuck a few to {M0.his}{F0.her} neighbor, who traded a cool sticker for them.</Text>
  <Text Key="15D9056F">{0.SimFirstName} knows better than to chew someone else’s gum, especially with all the flu bugs going around. Unfortunately, {M0.his}{F0.her} teacher finds it at Free Time and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} scrape all the desks. So unfair!</Text>
  <Text Key="A456C2A7">It’s not always the best move to involve the teacher, but seeing as {0.SimFirstName}’s only in grade school it’s not the worst idea. Caught with marker still on his hands, the culprit is sent to the principal and worse, home to his furious mom.</Text>
  <Text Key="BA4F9F41">{0.SimFirstName} is just placing the cookie into the open bag when a loudmouth kid accuses {M0.him}{F0.her} of going through someone else’s lunch! Before {0.SimFirstName} can answer, the teacher appears and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} write an apology, up on the board where everyone can see. No good deed...</Text>
  <Text Key="8A519B98">{0.SimFirstName} scribbles a note and passes it back to the kid: “Stop or I’ll tell.” The kid wads up the paper and fires it at {0.SimFirstName}, but it misses and rolls up to the teacher’s feet. For once, somebody else gets in trouble, and {0.SimFirstName} gets off scot free! </Text>
  <Text Key="7A1DABFF">{0.SimFirstName} picks a seat way in the back where the girl won’t go (too far from the board). Of course, now it’s a lot harder to see the teacher write on the board and {0.SimFirstName}’s not getting called on anymore…</Text>
  <Text Key="8AE447E3">{0.SimFirstName} finishes the last few questions correctly and decides to hope for the best. The school likes to brag about its test scores, but how much can one test matter? Unfortunately, the teacher thinks it matters a LOT. She assigns extra work for the next month to ensure that {0.SimFirstName} catches up.</Text>
  <Text Key="5DD86374">{0.SimFirstName} shrugs. Squirms. Then tries to explain about hard work and trying your best and how goofing off just makes you look dumb. It sounds right to {M0.him}{F0.her}, but the spitball that whizzes by {M0.his}{F0.her} head tells {M0.him}{F0.her} that wasn’t the right answer.</Text>
  <Text Key="7E876980">{0.SimFirstName} waits until the cafeteria monitor is near, then shouts for the mean kid to unhand {M0.his}{F0.her} food. The monitor quickly walks over and scolds the mean kid in front of everybody. All that AND {0.SimFirstName} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} bag of chips too!</Text>
  <Text Key="FC80ACEE">{0.SimFirstName} throws {M0.his}{F0.her} plane out on the playground, where the wind lifts it high. It does 3 loop-di-loops and a barrel roll before landing next to the slide! All of {0.SimFirstName}’s friends want {M0.him}{F0.her} to teach them {M0.his}{F0.her} new design.</Text>
  <Text Key="D8915DD1">{0.SimFirstName} makes up something about a one-person game and turns the {M0.boy}{F0.girl} away. Then, when {0.SimFirstName} goes to join the game {M0.his}{F0.her} other friends are playing, they turn {M0.HIM}{F0.HER} away! Hmm...probably a lesson in there somewhere...</Text>
  <Text Key="4ED5ACD2">{0.SimFirstName} walks over and taps the girl on the shoulder, then whispers into her ear. The girl rolls her eyes. “I know, Stupid,” she shouts. She and her friends start to laugh while {0.SimFirstName} shuffles away. How come {M0.HE}{F0.SHE}’s the one they’re making fun of?</Text>
  <Text Key="56C307C2">{0.SimFirstName} picks a seat way in the back where the girl won’t go (too far from the board). Of course, now all the cool kids in the back of the room want to copy off of {0.SimFirstName}’s work!</Text>
  <Text Key="A8E92EE0">Just as {0.SimFirstName} has feared, the teacher scolds {M0.him}{F0.her} for {M0.his}{F0.her} carelessness and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} come back at recess to take the test again. Angry, {0.SimFirstName} fills in a pretty pattern, not even looking at the questions.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D4DA646">{0.SimFirstName} runs into the hall, shouting, “Fluffy is loose!” Soon the lab is packed with kids on a rescue mission, and the gerbil is recovered in no time. Before {0.SimFirstName} shuffle away, the teacher stops {M0.him}{F0.her} and removes gerbil-handling rights for the rest of the year!</Text>
  <Text Key="663EB006">{0.SimFirstName} glances over {M0.his}{F0.her} shoulder and slides quickly under the bleachers, wedging {M0.his}{F0.her} body into a nice shady spot. {M0.He}{F0.She} watches for Kenny, the kid ahead of {M0.him}{F0.her}. Many restful minutes later, {0.SimFirstName} shimmies out, finishing {M0.his}{F0.her} “last” lap with a groan. Best P.E. ever!</Text>
  <Text Key="CE25CD1B">{0.SimFirstName} scribbles a note and passes it back to the kid: “Stop or I’ll tell.” The kid wads up the paper and fires it at {0.SimFirstName}, but it misses and rolls up to the teacher’s feet. Furious, the teacher sends them both out into the hallway.</Text>
  <Text Key="4617EDD1">{0.SimFirstName} places {M0.his}{F0.her} shoe carefully over the bib and grabs it when no one is looking. The new kid is so relieved and grateful, he gives {M0.him}{F0.her} his teething biscuits as a thank you.</Text>
  <Text Key="E89737CA">{0.SimFirstName} jumps off the bench, shouting, “Gross! What WAS that?” But apparently, everyone already knows and they think it’s hilarious that {M0.he}{F0.she} sat in it. {0.SimFirstName} goes to change into {M0.his}{F0.her} gym clothes for the rest of the day.

  <Text Key="1EA06BAA">Since {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t have to think about the answers, it’s a very quick and stress-free test! {M0.He}{F0.She} spends the extra time daydreaming. </Text>
  <Text Key="2B34BE81">It really is okay to take a short break now and then. {0.SimFirstName}’s brain reaches information overload, and {M0.he}{F0.she} goes back into class feeling more overworked than ever!</Text>
  <Text Key="EB0BCB97">{M0.He}{F0.She} made the productive, non-frivolous choice, and {M0.he}{F0.she} got an extra half-hour of study time in. Excellent. This will definitely make a difference, come college application time.</Text>

  <Text Key="7B390F86">It’s weird, but things seem to make a little more sense coming from {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates than the teacher. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} actually starting to wrap {M0.his}{F0.her} head around this!</Text>
  <Text Key="C767F1A7">{M0.His}{F0.Her} presentation blows the other students’ out of the water. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets the highest grade in the class, and the teacher submits {M0.him}{F0.her} for Student of the Millennium.</Text>
  <Text Key="5FBCC15F">How about that! {0.SimFirstName} has learned more than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought. {M0.He}{F0.She} earns a passing grade on the test.</Text>
  <Text Key="CC7BE000">{0.SimFirstName} spends so much time trying to figure out answers that {M0.he}{F0.she} leaves half the bubbles unfilled. {M0.He}{F0.She} would have done better just to take the random guesses.</Text>
  <Text Key="6E478A09">It takes a fair amount of self-control, but ignoring the bullies works. Eventually they get bored and move on to a different target. {0.SimFirstName} feels a little bad for that other kid, but hey, school is a jungle sometimes!</Text>
  <Text Key="13EE77D2">The other kids agree that they should just do it, but when it comes time for grades, the teacher can tell that {0.SimFirstName} hasn’t been pulling {M0.his}{F0.her} weight. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a grade lower than the rest of the group.</Text>
  <Text Key="269C0616">{0.SimFirstName} is so slammed trying to study for another round of testing while finishing {M0.his}{F0.her} regular schoolwork, that {M0.he}{F0.she} has trouble concentrating. {M0.His}{F0.Her} next test score is even lower!</Text>
  <Text Key="217BDADD">All high-achievers take the test at least twice—some five or six times. {0.SimFirstName} is confident {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} get the result {M0.he}{F0.she} wants eventually! </Text>
  <Text Key="A4247DFA">All {0.SimFirstName} has to do is walk around the lunchroom and {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are happy to share whatever they don’t want. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets so much food, {M0.he}{F0.she} might just forget {M0.his}{F0.her} lunch every day!</Text>
  <Text Key="0D1D4CAD">{0.SimFirstName} paints such a bleak picture of {M0.his}{F0.her} home life that the counselor insists on talking to {M0.his}{F0.her} parents about {M0.his}{F0.her} living conditions. Uh-oh. </Text>
  <Text Key="F78DD7C0">All it takes is a few answers to make sure that {0.SimFirstName}’s friend passes. Now {M0.his}{F0.her} friend owes {M0.him}{F0.her} a gigantic favor—not a bad position to be in!</Text>
  <Text Key="ABEDDB6E">So trusting, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are. {M0.He}{F0.She} picks an unlocked locker and snatches a lunch. Someone’s mom has a lot of time on her hands, because this is a feast!</Text>
  <Text Key="813DDF0A">The truth is that the material is hard, and {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t always feel compelled to try harder. The guidance counselor’s a little surprised at the honesty, but grateful that the issue isn’t something more severe. </Text>
  <Text Key="2B35219D">The teacher is still not back by the end of class, so it doesn’t matter that {0.SimFirstName} started {M0.his}{F0.her} other homework first. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} just do {M0.his}{F0.her} reading at home later.</Text>
  <Text Key="54A196D0">The teacher decides to provide {0.SimFirstName} with a little life lesson. (Isn’t it great when they do that?) {0.SimFirstName} learns that if {M0.he}{F0.she} wants a better grade, {M0.he}{F0.she} should study harder first instead of cry about it after.</Text>
  <Text Key="0A183F64">Although {0.SimFirstName} tells the counselor the truth—{M0.he}{F0.she} doesn’t feel encouraged to try harder—the counselor doesn’t believe it’s that simple. Now {0.SimFirstName} has to come back three times per week to talk about {M0.his}{F0.her} “feelings.”</Text>
  <Text Key="B27E2CD0">Although the teacher loves it, {0.SimFirstName}’s classmates grumble that {M0.he}{F0.she} made them all look bad. They’re angry with {M0.him}{F0.her} for throwing off the curve.</Text>
  <Text Key="15F92269">Even after all that work, {0.SimFirstName} still doesn’t quite get it. But {M0.he}{F0.she} learned that sometimes in life there’s credit for just showing up and trying—the teacher bumped {M0.his}{F0.her} grade up by a few points anyway.</Text>
  <Text Key="6C34B1FC">“Why, what a nice presentation. How straightforward and expected,” says the teacher. {0.SimFirstName} earns a straightforward and expected grade.</Text>
  <Text Key="EAB74BCF">The class can finish the assignment later—now it’s time for a game of Truth Or Dodgeball, where people either answer embarrassing questions or get hit by dodgeballs. That’s what the teacher gets for storing dodgeballs in the classroom!</Text>
  <Text Key="CFD29889">{0.SimFirstName} sets a new personal record for cola consumption and finds {M0.himself}{F0.herself} far too busy bouncing off the walls to prepare for the test properly.</Text>
  <Text Key="3955AE32">{0.SimFirstName}’s friend has never been known for subtlety. The teacher sees the crib sheet {0.SimFirstName} made sitting out on the desk. Both {M0.he}{F0.she} and {M0.his}{F0.her} friend fail the test, and get a stern talking to.</Text>
  <Text Key="F050EB43">If bullies responded to well-crafted arguments, they wouldn’t be bullies. They understand that they’re being insulted, but they don’t quite understand how, and that just makes them madder.</Text>
  <Text Key="B5EC2955">The principal acknowledges the courage it took to bring the money to him. He then launches into a 20-minute speech about honesty and integrity that {0.SimFirstName} tunes out of halfway through. But the principal does insist that {0.SimFirstName}’s teacher give {M0.him}{F0.her} extra credit for good citizenship!</Text>
  <Text Key="2BE9B20D">The project benefits from having everyone’s input. It’s a standout success and the teacher gives {0.SimFirstName} and {M0.his}{F0.her} teammates equally high grades.</Text>
  <Text Key="14FCAD52">{0.SimFirstName} earns a whopping 25% on the test! {M0.He}{F0.She} realizes {M0.he}{F0.she} should have gone with the repeating A, B, C, D pattern instead. Well, live and learn!</Text>
  <Text Key="F277E27E">The extra study time was vital for that difficult test, and brushing up on the material for the easy test was worthwhile too! {0.SimFirstName} earns a B+ and an A! Sweet!</Text>
  <Text Key="7DC797E2">The teacher’s drone is like a sweet, sweet lullaby gently rocking {0.SimFirstName} into a nap. But when {M0.he}{F0.she} starts drooling the teacher snaps {M0.him}{F0.her} awake with a detention.</Text>
  <Text Key="DA00994D">After thirty minutes of laughing and having fun with friends, {0.SimFirstName} feels totally refreshed and ready to get back to work. It’s almost like {M0.his}{F0.her} brain functions better when {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} well-rounded!</Text>
  <Text Key="9D1AE1AA">The straight A kids would rather just do something quickly and correctly than wait around for someone else to figure it out. They don’t mind doing {0.SimFirstName}'s work, and {M0.he}{F0.she} looks good at the end of the project.</Text>
  <Text Key="207678DC">Even though this wasn’t {0.SimFirstName}'s idea, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates are angry about having {M0.him}{F0.her} in charge. They refuse to participate or behave, and eventually {0.SimFirstName} has to call the principal for help!</Text>
  <Text Key="DAD313E1">The lost money gets reported and the principal orders a full locker sweep! {0.SimFirstName} gets caught with the money and sent to detention.</Text>
  <Text Key="878F4CEF">The owner is grateful to get it back, and invites {0.SimFirstName} to {M0.his}{F0.her} house to study sometime. {0.SimFirstName} didn’t want to get ahead by being dishonest.</Text>
  <Text Key="E5755AAC">Surprisingly, {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates do not like getting hit in the face with spit and paper. The teacher sighs and sends {0.SimFirstName} to the principal’s office. </Text>
  <Text Key="FE552829">{0.SimFirstName} really did know most of the answers for the easy test already. The extra review didn’t help much. That time could have been spent studying for the other test, which was brutal. {M0.He}{F0.She} winds up with an A+ and a C-. Not the best.</Text>
  <Text Key="35995C6E">If {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} only worked harder, if {M0.he'd}{F0.she'd} only tried again, {M0.he}{F0.she} could have achieved test-taking perfection. Everyone knows that perfection is a totally achievable goal and to settle for anything less is shameful.</Text>
  <Text Key="20DA35E7">The guidance counselor is so concerned with {0.SimFirstName}’s descriptions of academia-induced hyper-stress (an entirely made up condition) that she insists {0.SimFirstName} be excused from the next few tests. Nice! </Text>
  <Text Key="240BCC1A">{0.SimFirstName}’s teacher lets {M0.him}{F0.her} do some extra problems. The teacher would rather see {M0.him}{F0.her} understand the concept a little late than not at all. {M0.He}{F0.She} gratefully completes the work and earns a few extra points on {M0.his}{F0.her} grade.</Text>
  <Text Key="7A2C5926">{0.SimFirstName} really has been working hard in school! A few minutes into giving {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a quick rest...{M0.he}{F0.she} falls asleep! The slap of papers on {M0.his}{F0.her} desk jolts {M0.him}{F0.her} awake a short time later. Test time already?! Oh no!</Text>
  <Text Key="0EA88986">The movie is pretty good. This hardly feels like school at all! And {0.SimFirstName} always wanted to learn how astronauts go to the bathroom in zero gravity.</Text>
  <Text Key="8EAAA701">Wrong answer. Oh well—{0.SimFirstName} knew the risks when gerunds got involved. </Text>
  <Text Key="C0A76150">Adding something so difficult impresses the teacher. {0.SimFirstName} is clearly ready to get serious about {M0.his}{F0.her} education. Even though {M0.he}{F0.she} only manages an average grade, {M0.he}{F0.she} still learns a lot of new information that can be applied in class.</Text>
  <Text Key="02E2ED8E">Well, it feels pretty good to have done the right thing. That giant 0% on a major assignment doesn’t feel great, but it’s better than getting expelled, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="077FA50C">Once they see how hard {0.SimFirstName}'s working, the other kids start slacking off! No good deed goes unpunished.</Text>
  <Text Key="91794D5E">The rival suspiciously takes the notebook, but then blames {0.SimFirstName} for stealing it in the first place. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} has to explain that {M0.he}{F0.she} was just trying to do a good deed. Yeesh!</Text>
  <Text Key="35B2C632">{0.SimFirstName} refuses, blaming the teacher. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} heard that you can’t get anything past that guy! The friend understands and doesn’t blame {M0.him}{F0.her} at all.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0C8351B">This seems less like a study group and more like an opportunity for the smartest kids to show off how much they already know. {0.SimFirstName} is so far behind that listening to them doesn’t really help at all.</Text>
  <Text Key="ABEAE534">{0.SimFirstName} unleashes a tirade of poetic insults and put-downs, then drops an imaginary mic. The bullies quickly lose interest in harassing someone who’s willing to stand up for {M0.himself}{F0.herself}.</Text>
  <Text Key="CF9BF990">The good grade does bring up {0.SimFirstName}’s average, but the assignment is so mind-numbing that {M0.he}{F0.she} wishes {M0.he}{F0.she}’d taken something a little more stimulating.</Text>
  <Text Key="CE084AE3">Turns out that the class can be pretty interesting! Maybe {0.SimFirstName} will make a habit of this “learning” stuff. </Text>
  <Text Key="968DC45C">{0.SimFirstName} is no better off than {M0.he}{F0.she} was yesterday, but {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} no worse off, either. Although the teacher is disappointed that {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t show more initiative.</Text>
  <Text Key="C4C045C2">{0.SimFirstName} breezes through the easy test, and the extra study time on the harder test really pays off! {M0.He}{F0.She} gets and A- and a B+! Not bad!</Text>
  <Text Key="D715775C">Since {M0.he}{F0.she} has time to focus, {0.SimFirstName} finishes the reading early. Then {M0.he}{F0.she} gets to do some of {M0.his}{F0.her} homework too!</Text>
  <Text Key="E030620B">Right after the lights come up, the teacher hands around a quiz—{0.SimFirstName} has no idea what the plot of the movie was! {M0.He}{F0.She} gets an F when {M0.he}{F0.she} should have been able to score some easy points.</Text>
  <Text Key="1F3A9A04">The teacher’s errand didn’t take as long as he thought, so he comes back and sees {0.SimFirstName} not doing the reading. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets a lecture on the importance of sitting quietly and following orders.</Text>
  <Text Key="FFF0EA2C">The teacher seems as bored as {0.SimFirstName} is, and doesn’t even notice the spitballs, despite {0.SimFirstName} landing a papery clump right in a classmate’s ponytail.</Text>
  <Text Key="26F3288F">{0.SimFirstName}’s brain goes into hyperwarp as {M0.he}{F0.she} begins devouring information. Luckily, the sugar and caffeine rush lasts all the way through the test before a mighty crash hits. Nailed it.</Text>
  <Text Key="A6DADB24">OK, so {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t get 100%...{M0.he}{F0.she} got 98%, which is pretty darn good. Not re-taking the test means {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} happier and less stressed out.</Text>
  <Text Key="84DF13A3">Although {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not as wired and amped-up as some of {M0.his}{F0.her} classmates, {0.SimFirstName} feels good about {M0.his}{F0.her} decision to give {M0.his}{F0.her} brain a rest. {M0.He}{F0.She} takes the test feeling refreshed, and can easily recall all of the required information.</Text>
  <Text Key="AAD5209E">Sure enough, {0.SimFirstName} gets an A for {M0.his}{F0.her} beginner’s origami. (And the little paper frog even hops when you press it!) The good grade brings up {M0.his}{F0.her} entire average by a point or two!</Text>

  <Text Key="8DF3003C">Uneven Terrain</Text>
  <Text Key="07CADF08">{0.SimFirstName} is already running behind schedule when {M0.he}{F0.she} arrives at a particularly cluttered yard. {M0.He}{F0.She} clears all the kids’ toys, but notices there are still tons of sticks on the grass from the shade trees above.

  <Text Key="407E30F6">Behind Schedule</Text>
  <Text Key="34115772">{0.SimFirstName} mows right over the sticks and finishes {M0.his}{F0.her} route in record time. Impressed, {M0.his}{F0.her} boss promises to give {M0.him}{F0.her} more work, maybe even focusing on some tidier houses!</Text>
  <Text Key="EC2F680D">Better safe than sorry! {0.SimFirstName} collects all the sticks as fast as {M0.he}{F0.she} can and does a thorough job mowing the lawn. The owners give {M0.him}{F0.her} a grateful wave, and {M0.he}{F0.she} still has a working mower to finish the next job!</Text>
  <Text Key="19F0B0FE">Eager to Show off {M0.his}{F0.her} creativity, {0.SimFirstName} rearranges the flower garden, mixing colors and sizes to conceal what's missing. The client isn't exactly appreciative. In fact, he's furious. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss apologizes for the mistake and makes {M0.him}{F0.her} redo the entire job.</Text>
  <Text Key="4F7C1A62">That’s right! {0.SimFirstName} is a backhoe master! Guiding the machine skillfully, {M0.he}{F0.she}  suddenly realizes how much {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} learned. All this practice is paying off!</Text>
  <Text Key="C7EEF381">With a little creative rearranging, {0.SimFirstName} makes the petunia path even more elegant than before.  {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss is a bit nervous, of course, but when {0.SimFirstName} assures the client that minimal design is in, everyone praises {M0.his}{F0.her} forward (and frugal) thinking.</Text>
  <Text Key="6D09D466">{0.SimFirstName} squeezes through the nursery gate just as the owner is locking up.

  <Text Key="630F2531">Well, youthful inexperience only gets you so far, especially when a stick jams your mower. {0.SimFirstName} can’t finish the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} circuit, and has to spend {M0.his}{F0.her} shift clearing out {M0.his}{F0.her} blades instead.</Text>
  <Text Key="0DC4607B">{0.SimFirstName} isn’t paid the big bucks for acting like a fool. {M0.He}{F0.She} parks {M0.his}{F0.her} backhoe safely and uses a shovel instead. It will take longer and mess up the timeline a bit, but {M0.he}{F0.she} knows that it’s not worth taking the risk.</Text>
  <Text Key="41C10763">Yeah! {0.SimFirstName} feels like a true backhoe master…until the backhoe flips with {M0.him}{F0.her} in it. A note for future reference: to be a backhoe driver you need two things—a working backhoe and a healthy driver!</Text>

  <Text Key="44C25481">{0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are satisfied with {M0.his}{F0.her} findings. When you’re a spy, you start to get suspicious of everyone, after all. {M0.His}{F0.Her} trust within the agency has never been higher. </Text>
  <Text Key="07FEFA78">On his way out the door, the informant snatches up two weapons prototypes and {0.SimFirstName}’s lunch from the fridge. Sayonara, suckers!</Text>
  <Text Key="CE75D8E8">A criminal from the agency’s most-wanted list strolls onto the scene—with the item. {0.SimFirstName} tries to tackle him, but he gets away.</Text>
  <Text Key="88B42E01">{0.SimFirstName}’s handlers know that {M0.his}{F0.her} integrity is above suspicion. {M0.He’d}{F0.She’d} never turn traitor just for a few lousy Simoleons. It’d have to be an absolute TON of Simoleons. </Text>
  <Text Key="783093D2">Before {M0.he}{F0.she} can swallow, the guards rush over and pry it out of {M0.his}{F0.her} mouth. Really? Eating the evidence? The guards seem to show more pity than anger.</Text>
  <Text Key="6EF11D39">The villain brings backup, and only someone with a temper problem and lack of respect for authority could handle it. {0.SimFirstName}’s hothead agent makes some split-second decisions that save everyone’s lives.</Text>
  <Text Key="AB5C5AEE">Oh, right! National security! A lot of those secrets are not {0.SimFirstName}’s to give away. The deal with the publisher is canceled, and {0.SimFirstName} is sharply reprimanded by {M0.his}{F0.her} bosses. </Text>
  <Text Key="44B9BF11">{0.SimFirstName}’s mentor explains how he’s just been having trouble at home, and everything goes back to normal—until the mentor goes rogue during a mission and publicly announces his alliance change! If {0.SimFirstName} had told someone sooner, maybe they could have stopped him from flipping. </Text>
  <Text Key="D088AEAC">The other researcher does a stellar job, and {0.SimFirstName} promises to cover for him when he's in a pinch. {0.SimFirstName}’s bosses are pleased. </Text>
  <Text Key="84E299FF">{0.SimFirstName} knows these guys really just want a friend. After only a few minutes the suspect gives up his boss, his boss’s boss, and everyone else he’s ever worked for.</Text>
  <Text Key="E240AAD3">When they hear that {0.SimFirstName} works for Good, the henchmen relax a bit. Turns out they’re undercover, too. The three trade stories about the best places to hide an audio wire.</Text>
  <Text Key="F6624E2F">{0.SimFirstName} manages to hold out for a few minutes until reinforcements show up. Just in time, too—{0.SimFirstName} was running out of fingernails to have things shoved under.</Text>
  <Text Key="429CB2CF">The important take away here is that sometimes cheating totally works. {0.SimFirstName} loses, and no one sees that {M0.his}{F0.her} rival was cheating. Hooray! Another moral victory for {0.SimName}!</Text>
  <Text Key="29703DD4">{0.SimFirstName} tries to trip {M0.his}{F0.her} rival, but the rival’s quicker than {M0.he}{F0.she} thought—{0.SimFirstName} whiffs and ends up on {M0.his}{F0.her} back. {M0.He}{F0.She} loses the race and looks like a fool.</Text>
  <Text Key="9C18DEAB">The buzzing goes away almost as fast as it appeared. Things seem to be normal, so {0.SimFirstName}’s pretty sure everything’s fine for now.</Text>
  <Text Key="4BD60C35">All it takes is a stealthy kick in the shin for the rival agent to go down. {0.SimFirstName} wins the sack race and the admiration of all. </Text>
  <Text Key="2A7D4F1A">{0.SimFirstName} manages to switch off the phone without being discovered, but the moment is ruined. The informant gives up some intel, but not what {0.SimFirstName} really wanted.</Text>
  <Text Key="92E82C9E">The assembled Supreme Villains nod and applaud politely. Is it time to eat yet?</Text>
  <Text Key="CC27E2F5">{0.SimFirstName} wins fair and square, because hard work and perseverance always beat underhanded techniques! Yeah, {0.SimFirstName}’s surprised, too.</Text>
  <Text Key="BD51C853">The item they were looking for just didn’t turn up. The team gets out safely, but without what they came for. </Text>
  <Text Key="7F4AF9B7">Those pics will come in handy the next time {0.SimFirstName} needs someone on {M0.his}{F0.her} side or {M0.he}{F0.she} wants to deflect attention from {M0.his}{F0.her} mistakes. And if {M0.he}{F0.she} starts to think that extortion isn’t morally defensible, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} just remind {M0.himself}{F0.herself} that this is what secret agents DO.</Text>
  <Text Key="494E0F23">Just a few more minutes and the agent would have been a goner. {0.SimFirstName} saved his life. The agency and the agent are grateful. </Text>
  <Text Key="21D320A6">{M0.He}{F0.She} just can’t beat this one. Finally {0.SimFirstName} has to admit defeat to {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, and it turns out {M0.he}{F0.she} just had the wrong password. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss is not amused.</Text>
  <Text Key="46D9A5D7">The office is evacuated and a full bug sweep is done...only to reveal a malfunctioning pager in a drawer. Now everyone in the agency is laughing at {0.SimFirstName} even harder than at the guy who still had a pager! </Text>
  <Text Key="7F9ABD24">Anyone could have had access to those documents, so when the story hits the papers, no one can pin the leak on {0.SimFirstName}.</Text>
  <Text Key="528A45F8">Really? {0.SimFirstName} got where {M0.he}{F0.she} is because someone trained {M0.him}{F0.her} how to do it? What a predictable, expected thing to say. {0.SimFirstName}'s speech turns the whole room into a snoozefest. </Text>
  <Text Key="A7D9D2AF">A criminal from the agency’s most-wanted list strolls onto the scene—with the item. {0.SimFirstName} tackles him, and in the scuffle manages to disarm and subdue him. {M0.He}{F0.She} gets the package and a dangerous lowlife off the streets. </Text>
  <Text Key="9F99CB45">Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on sometimes. After telling {0.SimFirstName} all about his failing marriage, delinquent children, and addiction to home shopping, he feels closer to {0.SimFirstName} than ever, and vows to help get {M0.him}{F0.her} a promotion. </Text>
  <Text Key="114E69C2">Wait a second, these superspy catsuits don’t have any pockets?! How are spies supposed to hide documents and stuff? {0.SimFirstName}’s still trying to figure it out as the guards pluck the document right out of {M0.his}{F0.her} hands.</Text>

  <Text Key="8FC9572D">Praise is rare around here, but {0.SimFirstName} has earned a feather in {M0.his}{F0.her} cap, at least with {M0.his}{F0.her} producer. The Co-worker, on the other hand, yells at {0.SimFirstName} for making him look bad and then falls into a rather vengeful silence.</Text>

  <Text Key="C296FAE0">Getting famous is fun, but it can have its downsides. Like when a competitor offers {0.SimFirstName} a bribe to throw the next game. It's hard not to feel a little honored--and the bribe is substantial... Should {M0.he}{F0.she} take the cash or refuse?</Text>

  <Text Key="75D26CB9">{0.SimFirstName} has just noticed a section of software that is riddled with bugs. {M0.He}{F0.She} can buckle down and report them all by {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, or convince {M0.his}{F0.her} zealous Co-worker to do it.</Text>
  <Text Key="6A46110D">Bug Reports</Text>
  <Text Key="E5412D9A">The CFO at {0.SimFirstName}’s company is embroiled in a huge, public WooHoo scandal, and reporters accuse him of using company funds to pay for inappropriate services. {0.SimFirstName} can try to defuse the situation by brushing off the accusations, or agree to investigate {M0.his}{F0.her} colleague’s records.</Text>
  <Text Key="0744190E">{0.SimFirstName} sees that the next customer in the chat queue is an old flame of {M0.his}{F0.hers}, and things didn’t exactly end prettily. The other agents are tied up. Should {M0.he}{F0.she} respond to the chat request or pretend not to notice?</Text>
  <Text Key="4383CEBD">{0.SimFirstName} has been invited to speak on a panel at a local industry event. But when the moderator introduces {M0.him}{F0.her}, she messes up {0.SimFirstName}’s name and the name of {M0.his}{F0.her} former company. {0.SimFirstName} can either correct her, or let it slide.</Text>

  <Text Key="6328BAC1">Ouch! It doesn't take long for the crowd to discover {0.SimFirstName}'s use of the exploit, and they do not like it. The officials actually stop the game for unsportsmanlike play, and ban the 'sploit. Without {M0.his}{F0.her} one weird trick, {0.SimFirstName} is easily beaten by {M0.his}{F0.her} opponent, much to the crowd's delight.</Text>
  <Text Key="14663F05">Success! {0.SimFirstName} totally crushes {M0.his}{F0.her} opponent, wowing the crowd. The studio will almost certainly remove the exploit now, but everyone sees {0.SimFirstName}'s use of it as strategic. They start calling it "{0.SimFirstName}'s Gambit."</Text>

  <Text Key="E36F0CED">{0.SimFirstName} tosses the job to {M0.his}{F0.her} co-worker like a hot potato. It’s a nice thought until {M0.his}{F0.her} boss catches on. After a rather long speech about challenge, opportunity and the QA mindset, {0.SimFirstName} is sent back to orientation.</Text>
  <Text Key="FE52089A">How noble! {0.SimFirstName} alerts the competition, and the developers are able to provide a build without the exploit in it. It turns out that {M0.his}{F0.her} opponent was secretly counting on the exploit to win, and without it {0.SimFirstName} wins easily.</Text>

  <Text Key="610E7ACC">Kudos to {0.SimFirstName} for having the guts to ask for help! Unfortunately, nobody here has the first idea of how to do it, either, especially {M0.his}{F0.her} manager. And she would rather see {0.SimFirstName} sink than her.</Text>
  <Text Key="DA184313">{0.SimFirstName} feels a bit sheepish for leaving early, but embarrassing {M0.himself}{F0.herself} in front of a few fellow pros isn’t nearly so bad as doing it for the press. Luckily everyone is too distracted to notice when {M0.he}{F0.she} exits stage right.</Text>
  <Text Key="58FF8B97">Well, that didn’t go well. An employee points out that they’re all working for shares, and could be making bank elsewhere. They obviously have faith in the company; it’s {0.SimFirstName} who needs to believe in them. More people chime in, then pack up and walk out.</Text>
  <Text Key="A4F3B357">Nobody seems to hear {0.SimFirstName}, becoming suddenly very focused on work. Too nervous to take it any further, {M0.he}{F0.she} lets it go, losing even more face and drawing more snickers.</Text>
  <Text Key="C03E9EC2">Embarrassed and angry at being called out, the partner answers {0.SimFirstName}’s question rudely and begins to attack {M0.his}{F0.her} plan. {0.SimFirstName} tries to recover, but when the partner claims to have another meeting, {M0.he}{F0.she} is met with the door.</Text>
  <Text Key="78A2BAD6">Phew! Reporters soon discover that the CFO’s jilted ex is responsible for the entire mess. Reassured by the solidarity within the leadership team, shareholders invest more and the company’s stock recovers.</Text>
  <Text Key="1F4400FB">{0.SimFirstName} knows {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} not the only one who can’t take any more of this hateful 9-year-old’s outbursts, but it sure feels like it when {M0.his}{F0.her} squad realizes they have to play the next match a man down. They rebel and refuse to coordinate. The match is a disaster.</Text>
  <Text Key="C92CDE42">The great thing about being the {M0.King}{F0.Queen} is practicing on all the free mice and keyboards corporations send you. While the replacements aren’t {M0.his}{F0.her} favorite brand, {0.SimFirstName} is familiar with them and quickly gets a feel for the new controls. Victory is imminent!</Text>
  <Text Key="96E8A131">{0.SimFirstName} is a popular {M0.guy}{F0.gal}, and {M0.his}{F0.her} employees respect {M0.him}{F0.her} for being direct. The pool table is reserved for the weekly company happy hour and productivity goes up.</Text>
  <Text Key="15C32249">{0.SimFirstName} emails the concept to a few other studios, but no one bites. And now {M0.his}{F0.her} own studio has moved on to a new idea. {0.SimFirstName}’s game has joined countless other great concepts in limbo.</Text>
  <Text Key="3DDC7AC1">This time, work comes first! {0.SimFirstName} delivers a thought-provoking keynote that generates great press for {M0.his}{F0.her} company, and then makes up for the lost vacation day with a few indulgent after-parties.</Text>
  <Text Key="A878F693">Way to dig in and get the job done, {0.SimFirstName}! Sure, it might take some longer days (or weeks) to get up to speed, but {M0.his}{F0.her} manager praises {M0.his}{F0.her} initiative, even if she offers no OT.</Text>
  <Text Key="9BE68962">Upper management panics and decides to rush {0.SimFirstName}’s product to market, bugs and all. This can only lead to poor reviews and disappointing sales. Meanwhile the competitor gets to glide to success as the “improved” product. Infuriating!</Text>
  <Text Key="B2760C5A">{0.SimFirstName} isn’t sure whether {M0.he}{F0.she} comes off as gracious or spineless, but {M0.he}{F0.she} makes a much better impression than the moderator, who proceeds to flub her way through the session. The panel is completely ignored by the press, which is probably best for everyone.</Text>
  <Text Key="298310BB">Oh dear, Foul Boy has a foul mouth, and {0.SimFirstName} is getting the brunt of it. While Foul Boy unleashes a tirade against {M0.him}{F0.her}, the other testers take advantage and log several bugs that {0.SimFirstName} could have discovered.</Text>
  <Text Key="E203D7B3">Well, it isn’t {0.SimFirstName}’s best performance by a long shot, but then nobody’s on their game…except the new girl {0.SimFirstName} has been smack-talking with the most. She destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And destroys {M0.him}{F0.her}. And then the press destroys {M0.him}{F0.her} some more.</Text>
  <Text Key="77C1BD0B">Nothing is wrong with the company books, and reporters soon discover that the CFO’s jilted ex is responsible for the entire mess. Nobody blames {0.SimFirstName} for investigating, except maybe the CFO, but he has bigger problems to worry about at the moment.</Text>
  <Text Key="96A1F2B1">At the official pitch meeting, {0.SimFirstName} can’t seem to present a single concept without the CEO challenging {M0.him}{F0.her}. The other execs, sensing the negative energy, kill the project before it even gets a chance.</Text>
  <Text Key="BF4516E8">Apparently, all those energy drinks have Foul Boy a bit tense. He storms out, swearing that {0.SimFirstName} sucks, the job sucks, {0.SimFirstName} sucks, life sucks, and did he mention that everyone on the whole QA team sucks? But it does smell better now.</Text>
  <Text Key="7FF13C02">{0.SimFirstName} can’t risk permanent damage to {M0.his}{F0.her} system with a rush repair job. {0.SimFirstName} plays the tourney on a machine {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} never used before. The results aren’t pretty.</Text>
  <Text Key="D5D826B8">Ah, the joys of technology. It isn’t as easy to coordinate tactics when one of your squadmates is silent, but it’s far less distracting this way. Besides, this smart-mouthed 9-year-old has to go to bed sometime, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="CE8E46DB">The moderator seems to take it in stride, but a few minutes into the panel, it’s clear she has it out for {0.SimFirstName}. After humiliating {M0.him}{F0.her} in front of the audience and the mirthful press, she makes sure {0.SimFirstName}’s name is correct in the resulting coverage.</Text>
  <Text Key="8A23D86B">Ahh. That smells better, though it would take at least 3 more bottles to really rid the place of the offending odor.  Foul Boy is, of course, the only tester in the pit to complain about the {M0.men’s body spray}{F0.air freshener} smell.</Text>
  <Text Key="0D39E7FF">It takes time, and {0.SimFirstName} has to set all of {M0.his}{F0.her} other work aside, but {M0.he}{F0.she} finally manages to give the producer what he needed. In the next team meeting, the grateful producer calls {0.SimFirstName} out for going above and beyond.</Text>
  <Text Key="A2AC8B27">Phew! {0.SimFirstName} makes it to the booth, and just in time for {M0.his}{F0.her} shift! Seeing gamers play the game for the first time is a blast, the event is a huge success, and there’s still plenty of time to hit the show floor!</Text>
  <Text Key="B3471131">Welp, that’s enough from THAT 9-year-old! {0.SimFirstName} boots him, and even though the squad has to play the next match a man down, without the distracting child to deal with, they coordinate and dominate.</Text>
  <Text Key="40EBE51C">LAN party foul! A grown adult sweating in a fur suit for the entertainment of a few hundred gamers is sad enough, but getting dressed down by {0.SimFirstName} is just pathetic. The crowd quickly takes the Furball’s side and now {0.SimFirstName} has to contend with raucous jeers!</Text>
  <Text Key="2F4506B1">Just as {0.SimFirstName} predicted, the self-promoting superstar makes a pitiful showing. Unfortunately, the sponsor doesn’t know enough about gaming to see who the weak link is. Everyone is dropped and the team is disbanded. And Mr. Superstar will probably have another deal lined up by tomorrow...</Text>
  <Text Key="90F743FF">{0.SimFirstName} hasn’t made it this far for nothing. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} played tired before, and {M0.he}{F0.she} can certainly do it now. Three deep breaths, and {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} in the zone…and crushing it.</Text>
  <Text Key="81E712C9">Whoops. A press release reveals that the competitor’s product is not only targeted at the same market segment, but it has a radically larger feature set than {0.SimFirstName}’s. Furious that {0.SimFirstName} didn’t see it coming, management kills {M0.his}{F0.her} project.</Text>
  <Text Key="14568419">The sponsor suggests a practice round with software to track APM. Luckily, the numbers prove {0.SimFirstName} right, and the weak link is dropped before any real damage is done.</Text>
  <Text Key="77018E2D">Patience never was a virtue of this particular ex, so {0.SimFirstName} is rid of the problem quickly. {M0.He}{F0.She} can now spend {M0.his}{F0.her} time on more important pursuits, like completely disguising {M0.his}{F0.her} profile picture.</Text>
  <Text Key="35ED836C">The problem with attacking popular people is that they’re really, really popular. The sponsor drops {0.SimFirstName} like a hot coal, but at least no one can blame {M0.him}{F0.her} when the team gets destroyed in the first round.</Text>
  <Text Key="3550B044">{0.SimFirstName} strains to drown out the noise and becomes hyper-focused on the game. {M0.He}{F0.She} sees and hears nothing except his enemies evaporating in {M0.his}{F0.her} crosshairs. {0.SimFirstName} wins the round by a wide margin, and Furball and his friends go wild!</Text>
  <Text Key="C1328DE1">Phew! A press release reveals that the competitor’s product isn’t even targeted at the same market and has a radically different feature set than {0.SimFirstName}’s. Succeed or fail, it won’t have an impact on {M0.his}{F0.her} work.</Text>
  <Text Key="4969F8A9">Hang Tight</Text>
  <Text Key="40A0D63A">Success! {0.SimFirstName} presents the game up the chain without the CEO’s changes. Everyone loves it-except the CEO-but by now it has so much momentum that he green lights it as is.</Text>
  <Text Key="17EA7216">Without the interference, {0.SimFirstName} is able to clear everything off {M0.his}{F0.her} plate in record time. Not bad! Now {M0.he}{F0.she} should be able to take some time and get to the root of the producer’s problems.</Text>
  <Text Key="1ABFB62D">Lucky for {0.SimFirstName}, the relationship wasn’t as memorable as {M0.he}{F0.she} thought—or at least, the flame doesn’t acknowledge {M0.his}{F0.her} name or chat picture. {0.SimFirstName} meets this customer’s service needs, and avoids an awkward confrontation.</Text>
  <Text Key="3D02909C">{0.SimFirstName} has either overestimated {M0.his}{F0.her} skills or underestimated the project. Sure, nobody else in this cubicle pit could do better, but when deadlines slip and bugs appear, everyone looks {0.SimFirstName}’s way.</Text>
  <Text Key="B82F5C60">{0.SimFirstName} manages to make a joke of the whole thing, charming the audience and moderator with {M0.his}{F0.her} humor and charisma. The moderator gives {M0.him}{F0.her} extra opportunities to show off {M0.his}{F0.her} expertise, gaining {M0.him}{F0.her} valuable contacts at the event.</Text>
  <Text Key="D279E21B">Great managers know when to stay above the riff-raff. Whatever the joke was, it passes, and {0.SimFirstName} is happy to see more camaraderie on {M0.his}{F0.her} team.</Text>
  <Text Key="62584EC5">WAR MEADOW 6 is totally amazing, a huge jump forward from the 5th one that came out four months ago. And {0.SimFirstName} should have plenty of time to check it out, since {M0.his}{F0.her} boss will never let {M0.him}{F0.her} demo a game again!</Text>
  <Text Key="C8766168">{0.SimFirstName} should have done a little research before vouching for {M0.his}{F0.her} colleague. When the ugly truth is dragged into the light, {0.SimFirstName} is accused of colluding and {M0.his}{F0.her} company’s stock plummets.</Text>
  <Text Key="F2D3182B">Well, the table isn’t a problem anymore, but {0.SimFirstName} didn’t avoid confronting {M0.his}{F0.her} team. Forced to explain why {M0.he}{F0.she} didn’t just say something, {M0.he}{F0.she} loses the loyalty of key employees, who head for greener pastures.</Text>
  <Text Key="35F9B2D7">The media company is angry about the cancellation-{0.SimFirstName}’s picture is all over their marketing-but hey, blackwater fever is no joke. {0.SimFirstName} pulls off the lie, and is smart enough to lay low until {M0.his}{F0.her} suntan fades.</Text>
  <Text Key="345CE0D5">Fat chance finding anyone in this gamers’ paradise. By the time {0.SimFirstName} elbows {M0.his}{F0.her} way past the warrior queens, zombies, and plumbers, {M0.his}{F0.her} shift is already over and {M0.his}{F0.her} boss is furious.</Text>
  <Text Key="C97B4DDF">Looks like the old flame is still full of fire. By the time {0.SimFirstName}’s manager picks up the chat, he gets a blazing tirade, which he kindly passes on to {0.SimFirstName}. It is easily the worst service call of {M0.his}{F0.her} career.</Text>
  <Text Key="69A3C2F4">{0.SimFirstName} has done {M0.his}{F0.her} homework and it shows! Surprised but pleased at the attention, the partner sets down his phone and begins to question {0.SimFirstName}, giving {0.SimFirstName} ample opportunity to demonstrate {M0.his}{F0.her} thinking and secure some seed funding.</Text>
  <Text Key="41EC9552">Blissfully ignoring all incoming emails, {0.SimFirstName} manages to get a lot of work done. Unfortunately, none of it was the high priority work that the production team was trying to assign to {M0.him}{F0.her}. Now the team will have to scramble to pull an important demo together!</Text>
  <Text Key="5B0FD03D">Whoops! Who knew blackwater fever is actually a complication of malaria? Apparently, the company {0.SimFirstName} was supposed to be speaking for does. After all, it’s a media company, packed with journalists who live to sniff out lies. {0.SimFirstName} takes a beating online, but at least {M0.he}{F0.she} can let it blow over while {M0.he’s}{F0.she’s} on {M0.his}{F0.her} retreat.</Text>
  <Text Key="560CCF4B">At first no one answers, until the new intern shifts to let {0.SimFirstName} see his screen. It’s a doctored-up photo all right, but the ax-wielding mutant isn’t {0.SimFirstName}. It’s {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, which is easy enough to laugh off.</Text>
  <Text Key="45008BB4">Yes! {0.SimFirstName} gets {M0.his}{F0.her} system rebuilt just in time for the tournament. {M0.His}{F0.Her} fingers fly through the mouse- and key-clicks with deadly accuracy, earning {M0.him}{F0.her} thousands of Simoleons in prize money and a streaming video deal.</Text>
  <Text Key="6489F0BA">Bravo! {0.SimFirstName} makes a fabulous presentation. If only the partner had heard it! After a round of thanks and handshakes, {0.SimFirstName} is sent on {M0.his}{F0.her} way, none the richer for {M0.his}{F0.her} time.</Text>
  <Text Key="DE8C9E53">{0.SimFirstName} presses on {M0.his}{F0.her} headset and tries to focus, but an overexcited fan crashes into {M0.him}{F0.her} and spills “N-ergy Drynk” all over the keyboard.

  <Text Key="B2E82202">{0.SimFirstName} worked hard and did a great job. Everyone on staff was impressed, and the sacrifice was worth it.</Text>
  <Text Key="0682B965">This one was just too much for {0.SimFirstName}, and {M0.he}{F0.she} blew it. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she}’ll be able to handle it when {M0.he}{F0.she} has more experience.</Text>
  <Text Key="09792B42">Everyone loves the new book! {0.SimFirstName} even found a believable way to bring the character back from the dead. Turns out his death was faked to bring the team together!</Text>

  <Text Key="931ACB72">It was probably too heavy, but now {0.SimFirstName} will never know for sure.</Text>
  <Text Key="7C1F3415">The sweater denies any and all wrong doing, and lodges a complaint. {0.SimFirstName} doesn't get in any real trouble, but dealing with  paperwork causes them to fall behind in their efforts.</Text>
  <Text Key="C0A0B18C">{0.SimFirstName} strides up to the perspirer and asks them to clean up their mess.  They are apologetic and quickly rectify the situation with a towel and some sanitizer.</Text>
  <Text Key="F80C2C9D">{0.SimFirstName} gives them the benefit of the doubt this time, but if it happens again...</Text>
  <Text Key="B4462161">{0.SimFirstName} rushes to help, but the lifter is very aggravated at being interrupted and yells at {0.SimFirstName}.  However, {0.SimFirstName}’s boss steps in and reminds the Sim that it’s NEVER a good idea to lift without a spotter.</Text>
  <Text Key="16B6EC60">After a precarious bobble, the Sim gets the bar under control and completes the set. However, {0.SimFirstName}’s boss questions {M0.his}{F0.her} decision to let someone lift so much without a spotter! </Text>
  <Text Key="511B14AE">There’s no need to humor this amateur.  {0.SimFirstName} is above such childishness!</Text>
  <Text Key="7ECDFEE3">{0.SimFirstName}, a professional lifter, easily bests the cocky hobbyist. Still, deadlifting that much wasn't supposed to be part of today’s routine. {0.SimFirstName} feels sore.</Text>
  <Text Key="16EEECAA">{0.SimFirstName} isn’t quite sure how it happened, but {M0.he}{F0.she} ended up with their arms tied in a tidy knot around their left shin.  The judges are concerned, but not impressed.</Text>
  <Text Key="C5725AD3">{0.SimFirstName}’s strength and impeccable body awareness allows them to match the flex, and the routine finished flawlessly!  First Prize!</Text>
  <Text Key="E1DC5F9E">{0.SimFirstName}’s routine is flawless, if predictable, earning {M0.him}{F0.her} a second place finish. Not bad!</Text>
  <Text Key="F2C86E88">{0.SimFirstName} gets a hefty check out of the endorsement deal.  However, when word gets out that the product is nothing more than talcum powder and vanilla extract, {M0.he}{F0.she} loses some respect amongst {M0.his}{F0.her} peers.</Text>
  <Text Key="E1090169">Some extra money would have been nice, but {0.SimFirstName} only wants to endorse things they know well. {M0.His}{F0.Her} conviction doesn’t go unnoticed.</Text>
  <Text Key="4517FFE0">{0.SimFirstName} lets out a grunt, then a screech, and then an echoing guttural snarl, which causes the entire gym to stop and stare.  Unfortunately, these noises did not help with the lifting whatsoever, leaving {0.SimFirstName} hunched over and embarrassed.</Text>
  <Text Key="AFCD6D7D">{0.SimFirstName} grunts, groans, and with a mighty bellow, hoists the barbell up!! {0.SimFirstName} may have made a spectacle of {M0.himself}{F0.herself}, but anyone that turned to look was impressed by the sight of {M0.him}{F0.her} lifting an incredible amount of weight!</Text>
  <Text Key="2EFCE86C">There’s no need to turn themselves into spectacle, or worse, to get hurt! {0.SimFirstName} removes some weight and continues {M0.his}{F0.her} routine; the personal best can wait for another day.</Text>
  <Text Key="4E6166E7">{0.SimFirstName} tries their hardest, but they can’t pull off the trick!  The boy looks on in shocked disbelief at their failing hero. Something was torn up that day, and that was a young boy’s dream…</Text>
  <Text Key="044245AA">{0.SimFirstName} takes a deep breath, and wrenches the phonebook.  Miraculously, it tears cleanly down the middle!  What strength!  The boy is ecstatic!</Text>
  <Text Key="7B21BE6F">{0.SimFirstName} explains that phonebooks aren’t {M0.his}{F0.her} specialty, and offers to sign the book instead.  The boy is disappointed, but still happy to have talked to their idol.</Text>
  <Text Key="BD67A016">The drink tastes like having your brain smashed in by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.  {0.SimFirstName} doesn’t feel too good…</Text>
  <Text Key="DC5B9E1F">The drink is delicious!  {0.SimFirstName} feels energized and ready to attack the day with a renewed, citrusy vigor!</Text>
  <Text Key="B28FC89A">{0.SimFirstName} decides against taking the unknown beverage.  Who needs vaguely citrus flavored chemicals to feel good anyway?</Text>
  <Text Key="F3D3C792">{0.SimFirstName} decides to just put up with the obnoxious star’s nonsense, and ends up in a very bad mood.</Text>
  <Text Key="0460346E">The star scoffs at {0.SimFirstName}’s accusation, then turns around and complains about {0.SimFirstName}'s performance to the coaches. What a jerk...</Text>
  <Text Key="3C9C5257">{0.SimFirstName} can be quite persuasive when {M0.he}{F0.she} chooses to be. The star insists it was all just a bit of joking and pledges to lay off from now on.</Text>
  <Text Key="94827411">{0.SimFirstName} rushes to the bathroom and prepares for battle. Despite overwhelming opposition, {M0.he}{F0.she} emerges triumphant! {0.SimFirstName} then channels the energy of victory into the greatest work out of all time!</Text>
  <Text Key="3F40C490">{0.SimFirstName} begins {M0.his}{F0.her} routine and things are going smoothly. When suddenly, pressure builds inside {0.SimFirstName} then promptly releases itself. The gym erupts into pointing and laughing. So embarassed by the spectacle, {0.SimFirstName} quickly exits the premises.</Text>
  <Text Key="75C6733C">{0.SimFirstName} applies the new tanning lotion before stepping out into the spotlight. The judges are so awed by the sight of {M0.him}{F0.her} that they immediately stop The BIG Contest and declare {0.SimFirstName} the winner. What was in that lotion?</Text>
  <Text Key="34ACA20D">{0.SimFirstName} strides out onto the stage and begins flexing. The judges look carefully at {0.SimFirstName} before holding up their assessments. 7-6-8. Not winning scores. Better luck next time.</Text>
  <Text Key="33C529A7">{0.SimFirstName} respectfully refuses the cake offered to {M0.him}{F0.her}. It was the proper course of action, even if {0.SimFirstName} is now filled with an immense sadness.</Text>
  <Text Key="614446E2">{0.SimFirstName} greedily grabs the cake and proceeds to eat it very slowly. Savoring each and every bite. This decision will definitely have negative consequences, but {M0.he}{F0.she} sure is one happy Sim right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="010C7C87">Good ol’ water. Plain, reliable, liquid. It gets the hydration job done well enough!</Text>
  <Text Key="405E4317">It’s just water, salt, and lemon, right? Apparently not. The team refuses to drink the concoction, and many dehydrate.</Text>
  <Text Key="4F9923C2">{0.SimFirstName} concocts a beverage using some salt, sugar, and fruit. This {0.SimLastName}ade is surprisingly tasty, and the team loves it!</Text>
  <Text Key="7C14D658">No stupid lemur’s stealing {0.SimFirstName}’s dignity! {M0.He}{F0.She} takes them out hard, and the crowd goes WILD! {0.SimFirstName} is fined by the league, but the morale boost {M0.he}{F0.she} gave the team was enormous!</Text>
  <Text Key="C5DB8BB9">{0.SimFirstName} decides {M0.he}{F0.she} might be over-reacting. While the crowd certainly wants a fight, {0.SimFirstName} won’t give in to the pressure; {M0.he}{F0.she} IS a professional after all.</Text>
  <Text Key="7A8693CD">{0.SimFirstName} gives it {M0.his}{F0.her} all to the point of exhaustion, but nothing short of a natural disaster is getting the crowd back into a frenzy. Still, ownership noted the effort and was extremely pleased!</Text>
  <Text Key="6AE825FC">Sometimes you need to know when you’re beat. {0.SimFirstName} kicks back and enjoys the chance to watch the rest of game, even though their team loses.</Text>
  <Text Key="884426AB">{0.SimFirstName} stumbles as {M0.he}{F0.she} approaches the ball, and falls face first while taking the kick. It’s not even close. Maybe {M0.he}{F0.she} should have taken the costume off first...</Text>
  <Text Key="40AD3C3E">The animal legs are a daunting hindrance, but {0.SimFirstName} strikes the ball cleanly, and the kick is good! {M0.He}{F0.She} is carried off the field by cheering fans!</Text>
  <Text Key="3793F6F3">“Fine! There’s no rule that says the coach can’t take the kick either!” The coach rumbles onto the field, and the team is promptly disqualified, as there is in fact such a rule. At least it wasn’t {0.SimFirstName}’s fault!</Text>
  <Text Key="71B38AA3">{0.SimFirstName} walks out onto the floor and starts to dance. The crowd looks on uneasily for a moment before one brave fan runs onto the floor and starts dancing beside {0.SimFirstName}. Masses of fans hit the floor and the stadium bursts into a giant dance party!</Text>
  <Text Key="F03BD26E">{0.SimFirstName} starts to cough meekly and sits down on the bench. The crowd reacts to the lack of entertainment with a chorus of boos.</Text>
  <Text Key="11C32604">{0.SimFirstName} rushes down the hall after the fleeing fan. {M0.He}{F0.She} reaches out for their arm, but catches onto the stolen t-shirt instead. The Sim hesitates briefly before letting go of the shirt and running away. Good thing {0.SimFirstName} got the shirt because on second glance it's clear that this is the star player's lucky shirt!</Text>
  <Text Key="EDE15C35">{0.SimFirstName} stands still and watches as security goes after the thief. I mean, that's their job after all. It's back to doing the laundry for {0.SimFirstName}...</Text>
  <Text Key="43680D19">{0.SimFirstName} answers every question thoughtfully and articulately, then pulls a muscle thirty seconds into the game, and is sore for the rest of the day.</Text>
  <Text Key="CB326538">The game is always more important than the press!  {0.SimFirstName} has a wonderful match, but has left the ownership cold at their lack of media decorum</Text>
  <Text Key="D5EE0AA2">Loyalty can be a good thing. {0.SimFirstName}'s boss catches on to the offer and gives {0.SimFirstName} a bit of a cash bonus as extra incentive to stay!</Text>
  <Text Key="5EF1B567">{0.SimFirstName} takes on the new job. There's plenty of room to move up at the new company, so {M0.he}{F0.she} should expect a promotion soon!</Text>
  <Text Key="E8BB2E57">Promoting from within will ensure a smooth transition since the loyal employee already has relationships with the people they will be working with. {0.SimFirstName} is congratulated for keeping things running smoothly and promoting internal talent.</Text>
  <Text Key="690A142F">Not everyone reacts well to {0.SimFirstName}’s decision to hire an outsider. Although the new hire is performing well, employee morale has taken a hit. {0.SimFirstName} will have to figure out how to regain the trust of {M0.his}{F0.her} employees and boost morale.</Text>
  <Text Key="9FF2A392">{0.SimFirstName} catches some flak for hiring an outsider, but nobody can deny that the new applicant is a perfect fit for the position. {0.SimFirstName} is congratulated for keeping the company fresh and increasing productivity.</Text>
  <Text Key="2BAC21B5">During the next board meeting {0.SimFirstName} directly addresses the critic's concerns. Unfortunately, nobody seems convinced and {0.SimFirstName} is forced to make some concessions regarding {M0.his}{F0.her} plans for this quarter.</Text>
  <Text Key="20FBFD2C">During the next board meeting {0.SimFirstName} directly addresses the critic's concerns. {M0.He}{F0.She} makes a compelling case for why {M0.his}{F0.her} vision is the right one for the company and the critic is silenced.</Text>
  <Text Key="57BAFF3D">{0.SimFirstName} takes the critical board member out to lunch to discuss their concerns. After some friendly conversation, compromises are made on both sides so that they can put this disagreement behind them.</Text>
  <Text Key="A3CBA354">Upon release, {0.SimFirstName}’s book is universally panned. Shareholder confidence is shaken and {0.SimFirstName} will have to field embarrassing questions about the book for the rest of {M0.his}{F0.her} life.</Text>
  <Text Key="AC7AE781">Upon release, {0.SimFirstName}’s book shoots to the top of the best-seller list, displacing the Gobias CEO’s #1 spot. With all the positive attention, {0.SimFirstName} sees shareholder confidence soar! Maybe {0.SimFirstName} will use the profits from the book for a nice vacation.</Text>
  <Text Key="8B060280">{0.SimFirstName} is too busy running a business to be bothered with a vanity project like this. {M0.He}{F0.She} goes back to analyzing spreadsheets.</Text>
  <Text Key="3D2CFC4E">The owners of the business are so ecstatic that they share some promising new ideas they were planning to implement. {0.SimFirstName}’s kindness looks like it will pay off well in future profits!</Text>
  <Text Key="C4D3FE1A">{0.SimFirstName}’s offer is refused because a competitor has already offered them a higher price. This missed opportunity will not reflect well on {M0.him}{F0.her}.</Text>
  <Text Key="00B31983">{0.SimFirstName} is able to close a deal which will surely lead to massive profits!</Text>
  <Text Key="6B6A24CA">{0.SimFirstName} may have put too much faith in the start-up. It seems that the extra pressure of having a famous investor behind them was too much to handle. The start-up crashes and burns along with {0.SimFirstName}'s investment.</Text>
  <Text Key="E3B2D2F3">{0.SimFirstName}’s early investment is just what the start-up needed to complete their first deliverable. Now they’re the talk of the business world and everyone wishes they had gotten in early.</Text>
  <Text Key="ECCC183E">{0.SimFirstName} takes the cautious approach and waits to see if the start-up has what it takes to succeed. By the time it’s clear that they do, everyone has caught on and the opportunity to get in early is lost.</Text>
  <Text Key="D1FCDD41">{0.SimFirstName}’s boss seems embarrassed and avoids talking to {M0.him}{F0.her} for the rest of the day. Hopefully this won’t factor into any performance ratings.</Text>
  <Text Key="46B36328">{0.SimFirstName}’s boss thanks {M0.him}{F0.her} for pointing out the spinach. It would have been embarrassing to address the whole team like that!</Text>
  <Text Key="C50AB509">{0.SimFirstName} decides to keep quiet and spends the entire team meeting pointedly not looking at {M0.his}{F0.her} boss.</Text>
  <Text Key="7BAD7180">{0.SimFirstName} makes a joke about the inappropriate VP and the CEO frowns and raises an eyebrow at {M0.him}{F0.her}. Hopefully this won’t be remembered next time {0.SimFirstName} is being considered for a promotion.</Text>
  <Text Key="3C12C79D">{0.SimFirstName} makes a joke about the inappropriate VP and the CEO laughs. Yeah, that guy won’t be getting a promotion any time soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="04A74C8C">{0.SimFirstName} wants {M0.his}{F0.her} performance to be based on the merits of {M0.his}{F0.her} work, not the shortcomings of others. No need to make any extra remarks.</Text>
  <Text Key="987EDD4A">{0.SimFirstName} accepts the offer and is given a hefty sum of money. The new company leadership and culture means {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to work extra hard for a promotion now.</Text>
  <Text Key="79C5468F">{0.SimFirstName} decides that {M0.he}{F0.she} has worked too hard to set back {M0.his}{F0.her} career progression for a short-term monetary gain.</Text>
  <Text Key="E769A9B6">{0.SimFirstName} releases a media blitz against the legislation, but public support is too strong and {0.SimFirstName} only succeeds in making the company look bad.</Text>
  <Text Key="203D3BBF">{0.SimFirstName} releases a media blitz which turns the public against the pending legislation and makes sure it would be career suicide for any politician to support it. The legislation has no chance at passing now and business can continue unscathed.</Text>
  <Text Key="D555C177">{0.SimFirstName} can’t seem to find a way to adjust the company’s business plan so that it will be unaffected by the legislation. {M0.He’ll}{F0.She’ll} have to hire an outside firm to help with the transition.</Text>
  <Text Key="A6D90CBA">{0.SimFirstName} writes an inspired plan for the company to pivot their business plan in a way that leaves them unaffected by the upcoming legislation.</Text>
  <Text Key="30690CCF">{0.SimFirstName} loads up an email with cute pictures of hamsters and sends it to the company’s worldwide mailing list. Within minutes, a snarky executive responds with a sarcastic meme. For the rest of the day, {0.SimFirstName}’s Co-workers refer to {M0.him}{F0.her} as Hamster-{M0.Boy}{F0.Girl}.</Text>
  <Text Key="76A029B2"> {0.SimFirstName} hits ‘Send’ on an expertly crafted email which goes out to the company’s local mailing list. Within minutes, someone has responded and thanks {M0.him}{F0.her} for making sure the package got to them.</Text>
  <Text Key="3E1EC177">{0.SimFirstName} sets the envelope aside and continues with the rest of the mail. Later in the day, a worried-looking {M0.man}{F0.woman} comes by asking if anything important has come in. {0.SimFirstName} sighs and hands the {M0.man}{F0.woman} the envelope before returning to the Sisyphean task of sorting incoming mail.</Text>
  <Text Key="D0061C46">{0.SimFirstName} executes the sell order and within a couple hours, the investments have gained back most of their value. Looks like {M0.he}{F0.she} should have waited.</Text>
  <Text Key="F5D7FD8F">{0.SimFirstName} executes the sell order and within a couple hours, the investments have lost even more of their value. It’s a good thing {M0.he}{F0.she} sold when {M0.he}{F0.she} did.</Text>
  <Text Key="FD9F7C07">{0.SimFirstName} watches as the investments continue to lose value throughout the day. {M0.He’s}{F0.She’s} going to have to deal with some very unhappy clients.</Text>
  <Text Key="1491944A">{0.SimFirstName}’s patience pays off when the investments regain most of their value in after-hours trading. {M0.His}{F0.Her} clients will be quite happy.</Text>
  <Text Key="F4E5AB57">{0.SimFirstName}’s boss does not think highly of the ideas. Maybe they weren’t as great as {M0.he}{F0.she} thought they were.</Text>
  <Text Key="B42DF19A">{0.SimFirstName}’s boss is impressed with the ideas and compliments {M0.his}{F0.her} initiative. “You’re going places!”</Text>
  <Text Key="DDF9C71F">{0.SimFirstName} decides to keep the ideas to {M0.himself}{F0.herself} for now.</Text>
  <Text Key="39262DF9">The assistant is very grateful and works extra hard over the next few days.</Text>
  <Text Key="5E2BD298">The assistant grumbles a lot but {0.SimFirstName} is able to get everything necessary done and more thanks to the assistant's help!</Text>
  <Text Key="C2D3594D">{0.SimFirstName}’s speech doesn’t hit the mark. It’s not a disaster, but is quickly forgotten. {M0.He}{F0.She} would’ve been better off spending {M0.his}{F0.her} time focusing on work.</Text>
  <Text Key="E386D1E4">{0.SimFirstName}’s speech is the highlight of the conference! Soon, it’s being shared on social networks and is even featured on the evening news. All this positive attention will mean good things for business.</Text>
  <Text Key="4DA83595">{0.SimFirstName} declines the invitation. Maybe next time.</Text>
  <Text Key="789CAB02">{0.SimFirstName} corrects {M0.his}{F0.her} boss, but it comes out a little more harsh than intended. The boss looks annoyed, but at least he’ll get {0.SimFirstName}’s name right now.</Text>
  <Text Key="5FB1D32B">{0.SimFirstName}’s boss apologizes and offers to buy {M0.him}{F0.her} lunch. The confusion is cleared up and {M0.he}{F0.she} gets some face time with the boss!</Text>
  <Text Key="E2BE9156">{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t want to upset the boss, so {M0.he}{F0.she} decides to just let it go. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} will have to remember to respond to both names. Awkward.</Text>
  <Text Key="858726D3">{0.SimFirstName} moves a portion of {M0.his}{F0.her} portfolio into the aforementioned stock and by the end of the day, the stock’s value is half of what it started at. Guess this wasn’t such a hot tip after all.</Text>

  <Text Key="DA6F26A8">{0.SimFirstName}’s speech doesn’t hit the mark. It’s not a disaster, but is quickly forgotten. {M0.He}{F0.She} would’ve been better off spending {M0.his}{F0.her} time focusing on work.</Text>
  <Text Key="68DEFD75">{0.SimFirstName}’s speech is the highlight of the conference! Soon, it’s being shared on social networks and is even featured on the evening news. All this positive attention points toward a bull market for {0.SimFirstName}.</Text>

  <Text Key="2E65BD2B">{0.SimFirstName} is unable to distance {M0.himself}{F0.herself} completely from the failure, so it looks like {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} just have to take the heat for this one.</Text>
  <Text Key="F05B88C0">{0.SimFirstName} uses some accounting trickery to make it look like a different trader was responsible for the loss. It’s not honest, but you have to look out for #1, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="A7976DC1">{0.SimFirstName} decides it’s best to just own up to the mistake. {M0.His}{F0.Her} boss isn’t happy, but with some hard work, {M0.he’ll}{F0.she’ll} be able to get back in good favor.</Text>
  <Text Key="72B8A164">Despite {0.SimFirstName}’s best efforts, the client refuses to calm down and before {0.SimFirstName} has a chance to transfer their call, they hang up. Some people just want to be angry.</Text>
  <Text Key="E4591211">{0.SimFirstName} is able to calm the client down and route their call to the proper department.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F7D5889">{0.SimFirstName} takes a strong tone with the client, but it makes them even more upset, erupting in a high-volume stream of malicious intent. {0.SimFirstName} timidly hangs up and hopes {M0.his}{F0.her} boss doesn’t find out.</Text>
  <Text Key="8F176290">{0.SimFirstName} takes a strong tone with the client, who promptly apologizes and explains their issue. {0.SimFirstName} is able to route the call to the proper department.</Text>
  <Text Key="C068B205">{0.SimFirstName} glances at the copier’s manual, then opens it up and starts tinkering. After a couple hours of fruitless toil, {0.SimFirstName}’s hands are covered in ink and the copier is no closer to being fixed.</Text>
  <Text Key="C59D113C">{0.SimFirstName} glances at the copier’s manual, then opens it up and starts tinkering. After unjamming some paper and refilling the toner, the copier is up and running again. {0.SimFirstName} is an office hero for the day!</Text>
  <Text Key="8483400D">{0.SimFirstName} arranges an appointment for a repairman to fix the copier. Unfortunately, they can’t make it out until tomorrow morning, so people will have to make due without the copier for now.</Text>
  <Text Key="8F722B5A">{0.SimFirstName}’s email inbox is flooded with complaints of broken paperclips, jammed staples, and stinky markers. Looks like sometimes you get what you pay for.</Text>
  <Text Key="83D66BC3">{0.SimFirstName}’s initiative was noticed by the Assistant Manager who sent an email praising {M0.his}{F0.her} efforts to the entire team.</Text>
  <Text Key="E3A5AF8E">{0.SimFirstName} plays it safe and orders the standard supplies. {M0.He}{F0.She} has played {M0.his}{F0.her} part well as a cog in the company’s well-oiled machine.</Text>
  <Text Key="759E17CB">{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t know who did this, so the best thing will be to play a prank on EVERYONE! Unfortunately, when the stinkbomb goes off, {0.SimFirstName} is as grossed-out as everybody else.</Text>

  <Text Key="C867EBEA">{0.SimFirstName} doesn’t have time for this nonsense. Important stapling tasks await! The stapler near the mail room will have to do the job.</Text>
  <Text Key="F608CF50">{0.SimFirstName} launches into a story about a funny picture {M0.he}{F0.she} recently saw online. The CEO gives {0.SimFirstName} a strange look, then busies {M0.herself}{F0.himself} with {M0.her}{F0.his} phone. The rest of the elevator ride passes in awkward silence.</Text>
  <Text Key="FAEC9D6D">{0.SimFirstName} strikes up a conversation with the CEO, who ends up being quite friendly. It’s nice to know that the company’s leadership is still in touch with their workers.</Text>
  <Text Key="5835C99C">{0.SimFirstName} avoids eye contact and continues poking at {M0.his}{F0.her} phone until it’s time to leave the elevator. The CEO probably wouldn’t want to talk to an underling anyway, right?</Text>
  <Text Key="5F5F8778">{0.SimFirstName} sends an email to the accounting department to have them stop the embezzlement. Perhaps there will be a management spot open for {0.SimFirstName} soon.</Text>
  <Text Key="34B29C8C">After hearing {0.SimFirstName}’s threat, the manager laughs and informs {M0.him}{F0.her} that he records all conversations in his office.

  <Text Key="4BDF7D59">{0.SimFirstName} threatens to expose the embezzlement scheme unless {M0.he}{F0.she} is paid a hefty sum. Now {M0.he}{F0.she} just needs to figure out what to do with the extra cash.</Text>

  <Text Key="D47BB093">{0.SimFirstName} went the safe route and drafted a pleasing piece of click-bait that improves her work performance from increased reader traffic, but leaves {M0.him}{F0.her} feeling a bit ashamed that {M0.his}{F0.her} convictions are cheaper than an outlet fire sale. </Text>
  <Text Key="72C6E5DF">Unable to find valid sources in time, {0.SimFirstName} used all {M0.his}{F0.her} literary talents to side-step the facts which was a good exercise in creative writing, but at the slight cost of professional credibility and ethical standing.</Text>
  <Text Key="477303D0">Missing a deadline: out of the question! Compromising journalistic integrity: not an option. So {0.SimFirstName} submitted the fact-less story as (skillfully) written; which was enough to gain some recognition at work and a warm dose of righteousness.</Text>
  <Text Key="1C34AC35">{0.SimFirstName} refused to compromise {M0.his}{F0.her} journalistic integrity by selling fiction and submitted the story, on time, as (skillfully) written. Sadly, that did not save {M0.him}{F0.her} from a long conversation with the boss about good news practices.</Text>
  <Text Key="80FAABE6">Ignoring the social scene, {0.SimFirstName} only had eyes for the looks on display and as result left a bit hungry, slightly lonely, but impressed with the latest fads and more than prepared to take {M0.his}{F).her} work to the next level.</Text>
  <Text Key="C75ED359">Rubbing elbows and making connections for the whole event has left {0.SimFirstName} socially-satisfied with some insights into the latest industry buzz. However that left no time to eat, use the facilities, or watch the show to report back on the fashion.</Text>
  <Text Key="096D4711">Unable to fake being a fan, {0.SimFirstName} goes full on critic-mode to empirically assess the trend. Regardless of the impact of that approach at work, {M0.he}{F0.she} is content to back up {M0.his}{F0.her} evidence-based beliefs.</Text>

  <Text Key="D43E279E">While not initially a fan, {0.SimFirstName} kept an open-mind and eventually jumped on the trend band-wagon. That positive pivot gained {M0.him}{F0.her} career cred and, more importantly, some surprise creative motivation.</Text>
  <Text Key="0B0FC89F">Try as {M0.he}{F0.she} might, {0.SimFirstName} couldn’t overcome the obvious criticisms of the latest fad. Attempting to fake it was an epic fail that cost fun, inspiration, and positive self of sense.</Text>
  <Text Key="729B3CB8">For just one day, {0.SimFirstName} grins and bears the terror of bride-zilla for the sake of the work and this special life moment. Non-stop exertion leaves {M0.him}{F0.her} physically drained, but fulfilled both occupationally and financially with a unexpected tip from the grateful client.</Text>
  <Text Key="A35D6327">After the sixth last-minute outfit change request {0.SimFirstName} stands up to the bride and her excessive demands. The heated exchange ended well thanks to some well-spoken words, but not before {0.SimFirstName} lost {M0.his}{F0.her} creativity and some professional credibility.</Text>
  <Text Key="CBAE12A3">Opting to create a guide for quick no-look cosmetic application, {0.SimFirstName} had a blast making-up {M0.his}{F0.her} face on a live stream. And even though a thorough cleansing is in order, the career exposure was worth it.</Text>
  <Text Key="169BFA34">{0.SimFirstName} chose to live-stream a quick outfit overhaul for the fashion or time impaired. The fun but exhausting event was a success in {M0.his}{F0.her} opinion, and a source of new potential inspiration, if not a possible career boost.</Text>
  <Text Key="EE4C131A">The classics are classic for a reason. {0.SimFirstName} opts for a more conventional formality, dressing {M0.his}{F0.her} client in a tasteful but elegant outfit that hits all the right notes at the event. Job well done and well-compensated.</Text>
  <Text Key="7B69518B">They say you can’t go wrong with the classics. {0.SimFirstName} found out the hard way  that “They” were wrong, and the safely formal look fell flat at the event when people failed to notice {M0.his}{F0.her} (former) client in the crowd.</Text>
  <Text Key="22945F4D">Challenging convention and having some creative fun {0.SimFirstName} gambled on an edgy twist to casual attire for {M0.his}{F0.her} client. That risk paid-off and the name {0.SimName} became the buzz of the event.</Text>
  <Text Key="336010A8">Challenging convention and having some creative fun {0.SimFirstName} gambled on an edgy twist to casual attire. The bold move got all the wrong attention by landing it on the “worst dressed” list, a dubious honor that won’t soon be forgotten at work or by future clientele.</Text>
  <Text Key="6F9B6245">{0.SimFirstName} seamlessly pivots mid-stream, turning the unboxing challenge into a detailed product review which reflects well on {M0.his}{F0.her} professionalism, but at the cost of some potential fun and the chance to get inspired.</Text>
  <Text Key="C26D6BD2">With quick, creative thinking {0.SimFirstName} starts to experiment with the strange assortment of merchandise. The final product is a bit messy, but its uniqueness gains {M0.him}{F0.her} some work cred and a bonus payout from one of the showcased brands.</Text>
  <Text Key="79667A7C">Sure, it’s nice to have convictions, but they don’t pay the bills, {0.SimFirstName} does. And the bonus cash from endorsements sure helps cover the loss of any inspiration, work performance, or moral high-ground.</Text>
  <Text Key="79D229AB">True artists like {0.SimFirstName} can’t be bought. Sticking to {M0.his}{F0.her} principles {M0.he}{F0.she} tells the brand to shove it! And while losing out on some side hustle, maintaining one’s integrity is priceless.</Text>
  <Text Key="3D70DD96">Understanding the price of being a public figure, {0.SimFirstName} stops to take time for the fan, enduring frazzled contact and exhausting barrage of compliments with enduring charm. Sometimes a close encounter with crazy helps to appreciate accomplishment.</Text>
  <Text Key="8E9E8909">Better safe than sorry, {0.SimFirstName} shakes the fanatical pursuit, salvaging introversion energies at the expense of social contact. But hey, crazed followers are a sign of {M0.his}{F0.her} career progress (perhaps just not in this case).</Text>

  <Text Key="EBA8D3FC">Sims need to spend upgrade parts to upgrade items. Upgrade parts can be found in piles of salvage next to repaired items or can be purchased through the computer.</Text>
  <Text Key="2FECAA05">As Sims improve their Handiness Skill, they'll be able to upgrade their household items. Upgraded items have new benefits. For example, they can be unbreakable!</Text>
  <Text Key="BD072D29">Sims in the Focused Emotion will generally be better at Handiness interactions.</Text>
  <Text Key="12542F75">Broken objects can be repaired with a little time and effort. While repairing, Sims improve their Handiness Skill.</Text>
  <Text Key="ABE7D3D8">Handiness Skill</Text>
  <Text Key="4E2BFBFE">There are some powerful and easy-to-use tools that'll help you quickly build things. Let's examine a few of them now!</Text>
  <Text Key="4E269D12">Interaction</Text>
  <Text Key="2622E0CB">Search</Text>
  <Text Key="E7E2E389">Welcome to Create-a-Sim! This is where your story - and characters - begin. Click around and experiment! Click the buttons at the top to give your Sim a name.</Text>
  <Text Key="42BC9994">Looks are important! Click the Sim to choose their clothing, hair, skin tone, makeup, body shape, and more. Create yourself, someone you know, or even a celebrity.</Text>
  <Text Key="778F607F">Who is your Sim? What will they accomplish? First, choose an aspiration, which is a life goal. Click one of the buttons on the left of the screen.</Text>
  <Text Key="C695DDAD">Welcome to The Sims 4! We can't wait to show you all the wild stories you can tell in this game of life.</Text>
  <Text Key="8F271E68">Sims must Sleep to improve their Energy Need. Click on the bed and tell your Sim to sleep. This way, they'll be fresh and ready for their new job in the morning. Happy Sims make for better employees!</Text>
  <Text Key="2BA0108D">Now is a great time to greet your new housemate, Alex. Click on her to bring up a menu of possible Introductions.</Text>
  <Text Key="A0A39652">You'll need to know how to control the camera so you can see the things you want to see. Use the buttons and scroll wheel on your Mouse to control the camera. Try it now.</Text>
  <Text Key="5333C133">Your Sim should follow Alex inside the house. Right click on Alex's portrait to have the camera follow them. Then, click anywhere on the ground and select "Go Here." If you ever lose track of a Sim, double click their Portrait to find them.</Text>
  <Text Key="58EDBD98">Sims have basic Needs, and right now your Sim is hungry. Don't worry - Alex will prepare a meal for your Sim.</Text>
  <Text Key="4AE615CC">You can always get a preview of your Sim's needs, such as hunger or social, by the color of the diamond indicator above your selected Sim. As it goes from green to red, look to the Needs Panel to see what your Sim needs.</Text>
  <Text Key="8F77DBA1">Click on objects to give directions to your Sim. For example, click on the delicious food prepared by Alex and tell your Sim to "Grab a Serving."</Text>
  <Text Key="1BBBBE96">Relationships are very important to Sims, both for their stories and their Social Need. Click on Alex and select "Get to Know" to see your Sim start a conversation. Feel free to experiment with friendship or romance to tell the stories that interest you.</Text>
  <Text Key="4F87F517">Shift your gaze to the top of the screen to see how the conversation is going.</Text>
  <Text Key="F6E5152D">Your job starts tomorrow, if you need to find the time it's right next to the time controls on the bottom center of the screen. Here you can also control the game speed if you need to speed up, slow down, or pause things.</Text>
  <Text Key="92055040">There's many ways to interact with items in your inventory. You can click for options, such as choosing to read the book, or opening the seed packet. You can also click and drag an item to place it in the world, such as placing the seeds to be planted.</Text>
  <Text Key="A570A75C">Sims need money to pay Bills, buy better household items, and even purchase food. Luckily, we had Alex pull a few strings to get your Sim a sweet job, which starts tomorrow. You can choose a different job later if you don't like this one. You always have choices to make for your Sims.</Text>
  <Text Key="76945487">Actions that you give your Sim will appear in a queue on the left side of the screen. You can mouse over actions in the queue to find out more information, or click to cancel an action you don't want your Sim to take.</Text>
  <Text Key="011D351B">Alex has a welcome gift for your Sim. What a great tour guide! You should open your Sim's inventory to see what it is.  Think of the Inventory as your Sim's personal pocket, with unlimited space. Hmm, magic pockets.</Text>
  <Text Key="004106BD">Your Sim received an assortment of goodies from Alex. The gift included some seeds for a garden, a book, and something to decorate the home.  Thanks, Alex!</Text>
  <Text Key="BFAE40C4">Play around for a few hours by clicking on household objects, or watch what your Sim chooses to do. Have fun! </Text>
  <Text Key="6BBFC594">Rise and shine! Your Sim should prepare for their first day of work.  Click on the shower so your Sim can clean up and fix their Hygiene Need. Co-workers don't like stinky Sims.</Text>
  <Text Key="BCD3AA13">Click on the toilet to fix your Sim's Bladder Need. We promise we won't look.</Text>
  <Text Key="5023CBB2">Coffee is delicious and good for an energy boost! Click on the Coffee Maker to brew a cup.</Text>
  <Text Key="D0FD9A01">It's time for work! Sims will always go to work on their own, assuming you don't prevent them from doing so.</Text>
  <Text Key="7948AE97">Click on the Simology Panel to see information about your Sim. This is where you can view traits, age, genealogy, and other fun stats about your Sim.</Text>
  <Text Key="8CE7AA78">Your Sim is at work, but you can take control of Alex by clicking on their Portrait. Have fun, you can't really do anything wrong.</Text>
  <Text Key="B8683777">We'll leave you alone for a while to let you play. Tell Alex to read, clean up, or just relax. Or, watch what Alex chooses to do. Sims think for themselves and pursue their own agenda if you let them.</Text>
  <Text Key="D0FC9974">You have some free time after work to take care of your Sim. Pay attention to their needs, and if you lose track of your progress, make sure to refer back to your Sim's Aspiration panel on the bottom right to review their goals.</Text>
  <Text Key="98441176">Your Sim is home from work, a little tired, but with more money in their pocket.  Now is a good time to prepare dinner by clicking on the fridge, have a conversation, or relax with a little TV.</Text>
  <Text Key="948B4A33">Alex has the house to herself while your Sim is off at work. Remember you can take control of Alex by clicking on her portrait, so spend the day giving her things to do, or watch what she does on her own.</Text>
  <Text Key="E9E5C5A1">Welcome home! Your Sim is working steadily towards a promotion. Completing the Daily Tasks and Promotion Tasks are critical for career success! Click the briefcase button near the bottom of the screen to learn more about your career.</Text>
  <Text Key="7DF759F1">Sims have an Aspiration, which is their life goal. Click on the Aspiration button on the bottom of the screen to learn more about aspirations.</Text>
  <Text Key="ACDB1C22">Every Aspiration has multiple levels called milestones. To progress to the next level, complete the goals. Your Sim is on the right track.</Text>
  <Text Key="C4035603">Your Sim needs to work on their Daily Task to earn a promotion. Some of these Daily Tasks require your Sim to improve a skill or complete tasks for work. Being on track with work tasks will put your Sim on a successful career path. Look at your Sim's Career Panel to learn what their Daily Tasks are.</Text>
  <Text Key="9E802372">You now have Free Play time until you complete all of your Sim’s Aspiration goals. Check your progress in the Aspirations panel. And remember to take care of their needs, but most importantly... have fun!  </Text>
  <Text Key="54E29FC4">Your Sim improved their Skill! Click on the lightbulb button to see your Sim's progress with their Skills.</Text>
  <Text Key="759F59D1">Your Sim deserves time off from work. They can use their phone to spend Vacation days whenever they wish.</Text>
  <Text Key="60206D08">Your Sim can travel around the neighborhood to leave the house and get some fresh air. You can Travel by using the Phone.</Text>
  <Text Key="553A77AC">Travel</Text>
  <Text Key="DA5C3341">Travel</Text>
  <Text Key="14475B5D">Your Sim can bring Alex along for the ride, at least today. In the future, as your Sim makes friends and romantic partners, they can invite these Sims to meet out on the town.</Text>
  <Text Key="FBAD7124">The park is full of friendly folks. Your Sim should talk to some of them!</Text>
  <Text Key="0DCF822F">Your Sims might build several relationships over time. Keep tabs on their social life by clicking on the Relationship icon down at the bottom. Generally, if you need to learn something about your Sim, click a button down here.</Text>
  <Text Key="3FCE3A0E">It's time to head back home. Your Sims can always return home no matter where they are by selecting the Go Home button on their portrait. It's the teeny tiny little house.</Text>
  <Text Key="1246D309">Your Sim was promoted! This means a new title, more money, rewards, but also, more work opportunities!</Text>
  <Text Key="6A3F367E">Your Sim completed their Aspiration. This means they earned Satisfaction points to spend on rewards. Sweet! But, this is just the first step, and there are many more Aspirations from which to choose. Choose a new Aspiration, which will open up new story possibilities for your Sim.</Text>
  <Text Key="4FF8483C">You've learned the basics and are now ready to play on your own. Alex is leaving to help other new players. Bye, Alex!</Text>
  <Text Key="23F6CDE0">Your Sim now has the option to Join a new Career that best matches their new Aspiration. Use the Phone or Computer to find a new job. There are many interesting professions to pursue, so don’t be afraid to Quit and try out any until you find one that suits your story.</Text>
  <Text Key="0F5BFA95">Now that your Sim has the home to themselves, you can enter Build Mode to redecorate it to your liking. Add rooms, buy new furniture, move things around, and more. Take a look! You can tinker as long as you have money to spend!</Text>
  <Text Key="1CFD141A">If you're in need of inspiration, head to The Gallery. Simmers from around the world upload amazing creations to our safe community of creators. Poke around and download anything you like. It's free!</Text>
  <Text Key="CE836D9B">If you're ever confused or need a refresher, read the Lessons Alex wrote for your Sim in the Options menu.</Text>
  <Text Key="85B8C578">That's it, we're done. It's up to you now. From here, you can add another Sim to this household, which we recommend, keep playing as you are, or, start a new household entirely. Don't worry, this one will still be available to you.</Text>
