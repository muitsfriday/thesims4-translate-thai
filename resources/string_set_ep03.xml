  <Text Key="2F042DE4">That circus was so marvelous! The clowns that would show up in between acts were absolutely hilarious. I almost had a bladder failure myself from laughter.</Text>
  <Text Key="635E7794">The Circus was so exciting! My heart was pumping a mile a minute. I felt like the acrobats flipping over the spikes could have died at any moment!</Text>
  <Text Key="6D46F29C">The Circus was okay. I felt like it was a rehash of the last one. It had some unique acts, but for the most part felt the same.</Text>
  <Text Key="0F0E6B27">That circus was beautiful. I never knew people could be so flexible. The contortionists and acrobats were the best part!</Text>
  <Text Key="C4716919">That Circus was amazing! People were dressed so elegantly and the lights and sounds were so mesmerizing.</Text>
  <Text Key="0048F7C5">Attend The Circus</Text>
  <Text Key="9C8BD9E6">The Evil Beavers concert was so good. They played all my favorite songs. Even some from their Bucktooth Cavern album.</Text>
  <Text Key="D5DD0060">I am so glad I went to the Michele Bunch concert. Her voice is beautiful. We sat so close I was able to see the whites in her eyes!</Text>
  <Text Key="D65ABFFE">The Swinging Oliphants put on the most insane concert! At one point they had the singer ride out on a huge electronic elephant singing their hit song, No Fools get Paid!</Text>
  <Text Key="6458FC8C">The Hans Brodenhime concert was absolutely electric. He spun the most insane tracks. At one point he dropped the beat and the crowd EXPLODED!</Text>
  <Text Key="DF47E7B3">The Frozen Banana Emporium knows how to put on a great concert. Bret and Jemaine have the best dynamic. Their concert has the best combination of comedy and great music.</Text>
  <Text Key="231AD0AC">Attend The Concert</Text>
  <Text Key="F8919A83">The Opera was such a beautiful experience. Joey Botticelli has one of the most amazing voices I have ever heard in my life!</Text>
  <Text Key="8EA84143">Yaaaawwwwnnn operas are not really my thing. I can appreciate them, but it is not the most exhilarating experience.</Text>
  <Text Key="25A8999B">I am so happy I was able to attend Bob Pancakes and the 4 Goths Opera. It was so beautiful that everyone gave it a standing ovation at the end.</Text>
  <Text Key="10B1B0F7">The Seven Butlers Opera was enjoyable, but I would not recommend it to my friends. I almost fell asleep towards the end. </Text>
  <Text Key="6D5C9742">Bravo...bravo...bravo. This was the most emotional opera I have ever experienced. I will absolutely recommend Kelly and Her Falling Stars to all of my friends.</Text>
  <Text Key="5E690E9B">Attend The Opera</Text>
  <Text Key="C1640A2D">That play was phenomenal! Mark Kelly had such a beautiful performance. He totally deserves a Simmy!</Text>
  <Text Key="B560F03C">I heard such good things about The Tale of 7 Doors. I do not think that the play lived up to all the hype. I enjoyed it, but I should not have had my expectations so high.</Text>
  <Text Key="479AAC97">Willy and the Muffin Maker was one of the most inspiring performances I have seen in a long time. I would give it two thumbs up!</Text>
  <Text Key="89AB78CD">Snuffy the Red Headed Pigeon was an atrocity of a play. I would never recommend it to anyone. I almost walked out.</Text>
  <Text Key="BC2632C4">The Murder of 1313 21 Chic Street was such a terrifying performance. Who would have thought it was all a true story. I feel sorry for the poor saps that live in that apartment.</Text>

  <Text Key="6EF6BBCF">Welcome to the waterside Spice Market, San Myshuno's oldest and most historical neighborhood. The original owners of the famous Spice Market Pufferfish Cannery lived on this very street! Once their products went global, they converted the original cannery into a very fine loft overlooking the waterfront. Their great-great grandchildren moved to Uptown shortly after the karaoke bar was built next door.</Text>
  <Text Key="B2E0E0FF">The Spice Market is overflowing with family virtues and a sense of community. You can see it in the local art peppering the sidewalks and buildings. Add your own stamp of creativity to Spice Market by helping to paint a sidewalk mural.</Text>
  <Text Key="AE73116C">Uptown has become the heart of political discourse in San Myshuno. Stop by the public forum and listen to a politician’s speech, or better yet, give a speech of your own. Don’t be surprised if you see some unruly activists!</Text>
  <Text Key="4E2AB8EB">Be sure to stop by the Arts Quarter every other Monday night for the Humor and Hijinks Festival. Tell some jokes, pull some pranks, and purchase one-of-a-kind fireworks and clothing at the Swag stall.</Text>
  <Text Key="63689382">Cockroaches in your apartment getting you down? Forget how gross bugs can be for just a moment when you take a relaxing stroll in the Myshuno Meadows Butterfly Sanctuary.</Text>
  <Text Key="F48B237D">There’s lots to do in the Arts Quarter! Take a stroll around the sculpture pond, look for local street art on the sides of the buildings, or add your own artistic flair to the neighborhood by painting a mural on the street.</Text>
  <Text Key="E0BD8DE9">Nothing says “Uptown” quite like the local gourmet food stalls. Everyone raves about the Moroccan and New American stalls, but you haven’t lived until you’ve had a treat from the Uptown Cupcake stall!</Text>
  <Text Key="E98EEC63">Did you know that the Fashion District is home to the world-famous Torendi Tower? Take a gander and marvel at the decadence of the most expensive penthouse lot in San Myshuno.</Text>
  <Text Key="5E582B37">The Fashion District hosts not one, but two street festivals! Find love at the Romance Festival every other Saturday, or stop by every other Tuesday to get your geek on at GeekCon.</Text>

A simple protest, known as the Llamoid Sit-In, shocked the public with its extreme use of acoustic guitars, hair flowers and slightly tuneless singing. Though many years have passed since that day, the spirit of activism remains alive and well, and will continue until all Llamas are free to strut and spit and neck wrestle to their heart's content.
